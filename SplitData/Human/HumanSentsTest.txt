then ill show you what the zerg are really capable of
what the hell happened
youre nothing
do you remember what you did to me
i know you have personal feelings about this
everything is different
you guys did good
which part
i just dont think anyone deserves to have the zerg unleashed on them
cease fire
hopelessness
mr findlay your freedom awaits
i feel stronger
i had to see it for myself
general were surrounded
i am the swarm
do the remaining pack leaders will join me now
theyre in the state of constant evolution
if she says its important youd better believe it is
sooner or later ill destroy it
apparently arcturus sent duke here to reclaim me
our forces can intercept their raiding parties
all hands brace for warp jump on my mark
sweet mother of mercy
but its a chance to save those people
ah yes youre referring to your vaunted psi disruptor
just get us the hell out of here
prisoner step forward onto the platform
youre making a terrible mistake
were gone
youll never be able to forgive yourself for what ive forced you to do
doesnt look like i have much choice
only person you can trust is yourself
but the dreams
they dont die
look i know about your past i mean ive heard the rumors
let them try
he and his ragtag band of miscreants have instigated open rebellion across the sector gets blurred as jim focuses his attention on a photo of sarah kerrigani assure you this criminal will be brought to justice very soon
what heart
im going to find jim
he was trying to find out why the overmind made the queen of blades in the first place
it is certainly within my power but youre not a threat to me jim
if you decide to accept our help youll be branded as an outlaw too
stand your ground
chuckles my dear im afraid youve got it all wrong
i
thanks for the rescue but i hope it aint just the two of you
we all have to pay for our actions someday
change of plans
i stand for my people
today marks the third anniversary of the fall of the arcturus mengsk regime
i am kerrigan
devastation spread throughout all outer rim planets 
with all its glory and all its horror
now at long last you will die
what do you want
no
tell it to the millions you butchered
that was our real victory today
you magnificent son of a bitch
whether its blind luck or damn fool courage in all my years ive never seen anything like what you two jokers have pulled off
i sense something
the seeds of a new empire have been sown and if we hope to reap—
i used you to destroy the psi disrupter and now that ive got my broods back youre no longer necessary for my plans
if youre with me its your choice
who the what the hell are you
and you threw it away
zurvan
izsha prepare the leviathan
im a model citizen now
everything
valerian lashes out with her psi powers strangling valerian you left him behind
let him go kerrigan
you need to see this
this voice is not his
i used you to get the job done and you played along just like i knew you would
what did the fallen xelnaga amon do to us
zeratul
tychus what have you done
you really that naive
stand down
yes
when the xelnaga artifact made me human again it cleansed me of amons influence
you have your tense wrong
because i can offer you what youve always wanted
confirmed
its what you do aint it
and as i killed each and every one of them i knew what they were thinking fear
i need to cleanse it
im glad you saved me the trouble of killing him
who are you
do you even know what the dominion are doing out here
mark
izsha defend the hive cluster and the chrysalis until i am done or dead
why are you helping me zeratul
hes alive
do your worst then girl
realizes that kerrigan has reverted to zerg form no
ive sacrificed too much to let this fall apart
i thought youd like them
but the primals feed off the essence of individuals
make no mistake
shit
were not gonna make it
do that and you will earn your place within the swarm
leave it alone matt
then that shall be your epitaph
its never been our practice to operate in any one place for long but these zerg dont look like theyre going to wait
what is a primal zerg doing on my leviathan
i do
i hope to god it does what we think it does
your boy mengsk has gone crazy for them
i knew youd return to your true form
the xelnaga artifacts been assembled
you wont find my father here commander
all batteries concentrate forward firepower
shes come to finish the job
its been four years you show up outta nowhere and
do you still believe in me
that thing may be the key to stopping the queen of blades
i said you are free to go
so gerard
you let those shuttles go
and if i survive it will remake me
i feel the swarm
grabs swann by the shirt who struggles to escape  pathetic
this is about building a better tomorrow
sarah you dont have to do this
i will not be stopped
nothing stands in the way of the swarm
dont even think to cross me
jim
let no human deny the perils of our time
than how would you characterize this statement
a trace of something dark but long gone
care to explain yourself boy
you know of course that my organization operates outside the bounds of confederate law
quickly destroy the eggs before they hatch
there will be ruin destruction millions could die amid the chaos
what my enemies fear most
are you prepared to go all the way with this alexei
there is a gateway to the void within ulnar
way i see it if zeratul believed you could make a difference in all this then this fights just begun
that is correct general
did you know the ancient one would turn on me
theyre dead artanis
face me narud
ive invited commander raynor here to assist us  with any unforeseen contingencies
you might be a damn pirate raynor but whatever happens you saved my boys today
why are you doing this kerrigan
its bloody
these moments together they will always be with me
i held the line while you and your terrorist friends hid under a rock
youre taking us back to char
does that mean theyre gonna send some backup for us
i will rule this sector or see it burnt to ashes around me
i said leave it alone
i go free
i will sacrifice anything to achieve my goal
no
them
