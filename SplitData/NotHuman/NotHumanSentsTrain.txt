they gather essence for thousands of years
the UNK shall UNK you no longer
this invasion is a UNK from the battle ahead
they fight yagdras brood
for he truly can UNK worlds apart
a drone can harvest biomass from this quillgor
my queen UNK did we wake the ancient one

you can destroy all of the UNK here it will do you no good
primal zerg forces are massing nearby
they UNK to stop you from UNK with the ancient one
for now we are free
must take sample
do not UNK that it was his UNK that brought ruin to aiur
as is your UNK to UNK the greater UNK of UNK
it is and a UNK fate for a strong primal zerg
amon
the biomass is in UNK to the ancient one
your path is clear

for today we will UNK the glory of our legacy
the great templar were still UNK by order of the conclave
the primal zerg UNK upon you
they evolve
aiur shall not UNK
how can this be
is that how you UNK this
amon
the ancient one will required more to awaken
you are zerg
have you any UNK of what youve created here
we UNK to UNK you while it was we who were in UNK

the power of zerus called you here
our master has already won alarak
my pack is strong
it is to zerus you must go UNK altered UNK from the final UNK
they were the first creation UNK with a purity of form
soon shall our two UNK be made as one

one UNK and one UNK strong
you will lead our people to their doom
i am UNK one who collects
those protoss would kill you if they could
believe
do you know about the UNK done on UNK
only a xelnaga can defeat the UNK one
to think that you were our UNK hope our most beloved UNK
a primal zerg who witnessed the creation of the overmind
i bring UNK of doom
primal UNK UNK
last UNK of the cycle
you have our blades kerrigan
it is tassadar my UNK
you are on the path and no longer need my UNK
they fight they kill they evolve
and may the UNK UNK guide us
the zealots around artanis and selendis UNK and hold their UNK in UNK

your UNK means nothing
UNK your UNK UNK
i have UNK the veil of the UNK and UNK only oblivion

and that UNK UNK UNK upon me artanis i have UNK a way to stand against the coming UNK
you UNK so much power
kerrigan UNK his psi blade as well
alone it is UNK that those of our kind UNK UNK from the glory of the khala
UNK the eternal mother UNK and UNK
you UNK
all i behold is an UNK
root our swarm hosts and crawlers by that entrance
its UNK in the UNK order was UNK when the stars were UNK
strike as one will
if you seek our power you must become primal zerg
do not let yours aid malash
it shall be your UNK
if our UNK are on this world we have clearly evolved a great UNK
in our UNK and UNK we UNK that UNK UNK and UNK into ruin
i hope it is so
but we shall not break
the dark one has been UNK back into the void
it appears we have much to UNK
defend the chrysalis
let our last stand UNK a UNK so UNK that we will be known UNK eternity
yet some of us were UNK UNK
they lost their UNK and became his UNK
this UNK
you must feel the power

can we now
they will break your enemies
you have come to UNK UNK you
UNK and UNK
UNK nearby zerg and self
we must protect it while it UNK
as do i
my queen enemy primals are massing nearby
if your UNK UNK you strong enough the power of zerus will be yours
tyrannozor sample acquired
collect their essence
i do not like it
must be UNK clean
UNK locusts to kill enemies
these are lies artanis
all zerus feel it
with it i bring an end to the cycle an end to the infinite UNK
truly this world is yours now
brakk UNK now
this comes too late to you but the conclave has witnessed your defeat of the cerebrate
taldarim
a drone is under attack by brakks forces
amon betrayed us and for that he must UNK
the primals are attacking the chrysalis
the UNK zeratul followed the UNK of my psionic UNK into the minds of UNK UNK
what a UNK UNK
each has sent most of its pack against your swarm UNK UNK vulnerable
my UNK this is our final hour
the chrysalis is under attack
new form can UNK essence UNK UNK
it lies far beyond the koprulu sector UNK known UNK
kill them and you will command the whole of the zerg
UNK your UNK with the
you UNK to see me UNK
for now we fight for the belief that our kind has not UNK its end that we protoss can stand bound by a belief in unity and that we protoss will forge a great and mighty new civilization
these UNK UNK when they sense you
well done cerebrate
arise kerrigan
purity of essence
with the essence of the great UNK your people fulfill their purpose
for the protoss too were created by the xelnaga
no
no
you are right of course
your UNK UNK are no UNK for the might of the primal zerg
alarak
it is UNK judicator
root our swarm hosts and crawlers by that entrance
the overmind has come to destroy all that we hold UNK and assimilate us into UNK
a thousand UNK UNK the flesh
zerus will consume you
you will not see me again kerrigan
i sensed another pack of primal zerg gathering at across basin
not only have you damned yourself but you have damned those who have followed you
kerrigan
you must UNK this invasion at once
you UNK what is greatest in us all and all our hopes go with you
i will use them both to UNK amons betrayal
your belief is not required
UNK different at UNK
take what is UNK
the first zerg
UNK UNK primal essence
the UNK you seek lie within
UNK raynor
you have killed brakk but his packs survives
i sensed another pack of primal zerg gathering at across basin
it UNK with a great UNK
they kill
it is time
ready for your UNK
swarm on UNK for UNK UNK already being UNK
the battle is already won
primal zerg
do not let amon consume you
both packs are moving against us
UNK at artanis UNK as one whom UNK defeat
UNK these primals the fury of the swarm
essence useful must acquire
yagdras forces are gathering
this UNK cannot be UNK
the power is more ancient even than i
our UNK broke his ancient UNK and UNK us low
we came from this place
we have been through much together zeratul but far too many have UNK in the hopes that this moment could come to UNK
UNK UNK
the swarm brought ruin to our world
do not test me taldarim
spawn many locusts to defend hive cluster from primal attacks
death is the fate of all warriors a fate we too may soon embrace
we must remain UNK on protecting the chrysalis
extreme physical prowess
youve already lost voice UNK back to UNK amon UNK
the moment draws near
new form powerful can UNK through UNK strike UNK
it is only beginning
you must become pure
maintain out defense
it is not in my place to UNK the order of a judicator
artanis hierarch of the UNK UNK UNK of the templar
we were fools to have UNK UNK with this UNK
UNK UNK
your essence UNK with your power
if you truly seek the power of zerus you will need the ancient one
she is xelnaga
primal UNK
en taro zeratul
only the UNK survive
spawn many locusts to defend hive cluster from primal attacks
destroy primal zerg
