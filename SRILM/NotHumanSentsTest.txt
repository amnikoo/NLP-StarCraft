and though justice demands that she die for her crimes only she can save us
my pack arrives
nowhere to run
but you will not be so fortunate
will it not destroy us
we will devour your flesh
they gather even now preparing to destroy us
this may be the great enemys trickery
why aldaris gave you this order
my queen
i do not come as your enemy dark templar
how  how can this be
today that lie must come to its end and with it our prejudice and arrogance must become a thing of the past
approach absorb essence
you will bring more essence and i will follow
awaken my child and embrace the glory that is your birthright
amon will bring the full might of the great fleet to bear against us of that there is no doubt
artanis now you see
kill
and now the swarm owns zerus
struggle it only makes you taste smear
yes but that is irrelevant
more roaches
grow children grow
we will gather the survivors rebuild our cities
for our warrior hearts are bound by honor tradition
zeratul comes to his feet you shall not stand against me
they are preparing to attack the hive cluster
a form i chose to inspire action in the one called zeratul in you
looks up out into space it is kerrigan
they fight
zeratul looks away grimly executor commence the invasion
the invasion fleet stands ready
zeratul foresaw this day would come
birthplace of the zerg
that will not be easy
he told you of his return
if the queen of blades truly wishes to speak she would be here now
rid yourselves of amon
it was his cloned personality that was used for the purifier prototype
we will reject our old divisions and forge a new society
it is your custom to shake the hand of a friend is it not
we will have to cross the battle between brakk and yagdras packs
you will see him soon
and i say to thee this shall not come to pass
i feel your strength you will be worth killing worth the blood
your violence young prodigal is typical
behold zerus
our drone must be protected
the merging of purity of essence and purity of form must continue
fenix welcome aboard the spear of adun
those left behind are the primal zerg
the swarm will prevail
matriarch there is a massive output of void energies spiking from the temple below
selendis
a grim reminder of battles lost and battles won
do your people believe in this cause as you do
your swarm bears the mark of amon the fallen xelnaga who came to zerus long ago
unacceptable
you know this
a primal pack leader of boundless power
i am alarak first ascendant of the taldarim
zerus birthworld of the zerg
you intrude on my territory corrupt zerg
they know now that they cannot deny the necessity or the valiancy of your actions
now i come to you because i feel your change
en taro tassadar
chuckles  so you do understand my culture after all
and i am reunited with the dearest of friends
we have recovered half of the biomass needed to awaken the ancient
you will side with me and together we will send him back to the abyss
there you will be tested
evolve
i would sooner die dark one than tarnish the memory of aiur by joining with you
we will grow stronger here
now shall the events set into motion so long ago be made complete
this ends now corrupt zerg
i
 arrogance
know that i am the overmind the eternal will of the swarm and that you have been created to serve me
varied
we must move quickly if we are to secure their biomass
our drone must be protected
broodmother kilysa relayed this to us
karax these tests are no longer needed
your appearance does not matter
have made important discovery
he is one with the void it is an extension of his will binding me as prisoner
you grow greedy
what matters is that they obey
essence collects quickly
for we are bound by the khala the sacred union of our every thought and emotion
primal zerg reactionary improvised
our queen is beginning to awakened
the end war has come
successful
we need more swarm hosts morph more from the larvae at our hatchery
by the rite of rakshir i am your highlord
our kind once stood as stewards of a galaxy full of promise
ah tassadar have you fallen so far
yes my queen
to reach it we must cross the battle between brakk and yagdras packs
my life ignites his warp blade for aiur
one will be consumed and become something greater than either
you choose to rule differently than i alarak
use frequently
study it well
i was given a directive by aldaris himself to come to glacius and serve the templar
unsuccessful
the xelnaga wish you restored as the leader of the swarm
the hunt goes well my queen
learn its secrets and take its power
delighted  oh yes i feel his rage washing over me he knows i no longer fear him he knows that the taldarim have no khala for him to control
behold the culmination of your history
when you do not i will not
it ends in utter darkness
all zerus fears it and you
 dryly you care little for my survival alarak
why are you here fenix
amon
your nerve cords chain you to his will they must be removed
functions similar to hive spawns primals
yagdras forces are gathering
tassadar
hear me broken zerg
our queens metamorphosis is half way complete
here i am prisoner
the end of all things
source personality
more of my pack joins you
executor i stand ready
is that not enough
you have come to this place seeking power
battle is waged in the name of the many the brave who generation after generation choose the mantle of
defend the chrysalis
i seek essence
complete
watch your words or my blade will watch them for you
you will take us to artanis
dynamic
and are you the equal of amon who once controlled you
she will not wake
it is time
let us say that for now we have struck another bargain
i claim their territory and their essence
it calls to you
it existed before names
prepare for a pincer attack
you will have your power and you will lose yourself
it is from 
you will regret this decision kerrigan
more than the old queen of blades ever did
defend the chrysalis
they are converging upon the hive cluster
they are preparing to attack the hive cluster
but we were independent we would not follow
primal essence gathering within the pool
