<dl><dd><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcturus_Mengsk" class="extiw" title="w:Arcturus Mengsk">Arcturus Mengsk</a></b>: Good day, magistrate. My name is Arcturus Mengsk, and I represent the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Korhal" class="extiw" title="w:Sons of Korhal">Sons of Korhal</a>. You're familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederacy_of_Man" class="extiw" title="w:Confederacy of Man">Confederate</a>
 propaganda surrounding my group, but your reputation suggests you'll 
see past it. It's never been our practice to operate in any one place 
for long, but these Zerg don't look like they're going to wait. I'm 
going to make you an offer, magistrate. I'd like to help you out by 
sending down a number of transports to your colony and evacuating any 
survivors. You know, of course, that my organization operates outside 
the bounds of Confederate law. That's why they spread their lies and 
misinformation. If you decide to accept our help, you'll be branded as 
an outlaw too. But, it's a chance to save those people. Time to make a 
stand, magistrate.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: I'm having doubts about this, Arcturus. I just don't think anyone deserves to have the zerg unleashed on them.</dd>
<dd><b>Arcturus Mengsk</b>: I know you have personal feelings about 
this. But you can't let your past cloud your judgement. Carry out your 
orders, Lieutenant.</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: Yes, sir.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: Psi Emitter in place. Just promise me we'll never do anything like this again.</dd>
<dd><b>Arcturus Mengsk</b>: We will do whatever it takes to save humanity. Our responsibility is too great to do anything less.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Raynor" class="extiw" title="w:Jim Raynor">Jim Raynor</a></b>:
 Why are you doing this, Kerrigan? Look, I know about your past, I mean 
I've heard the rumors. I know you were part of those experiments with 
the Zerg, that Mengsk came and saved you. But you don't owe him this. 
Hell... I've saved your butt plenty of times.</dd>
<dd><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kerrigan" class="extiw" title="w:Sarah Kerrigan">Sarah Kerrigan</a></b>:
 Jimmy, drop the knight in shining armor routine. It suits you 
sometimes, just... not now. I don't need to be rescued. I know what I'm 
doing. The Protoss are coming to destroy the entire planet, not just the
 Zerg. I know that because... well, I just know it. I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_agent" class="extiw" title="w:Ghost agent">ghost</a>, remember? Once we dealt with the Protoss, we can do something about the Zerg. Arcturus'll come around. I know he will.</dd>
<dd><b>Jim Raynor</b>: I hope you're right, darling. Good huntin'!</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Arcturus Mengsk</b>: Gentlemen, you've done <i>very</i> well, but remember that we've still got a job to do. The seeds of a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terran_Dominion" class="extiw" title="w:Terran Dominion">Empire</a> have been sown, and if we hope to reap—</dd>
<dd><b>Jim Raynor</b>: Ah, to <i>hell</i> with you!</dd>
<dd><b>Arcturus Mengsk</b>: You're making a terrible mistake. Don't even <i>think</i> to cross me! I've sacrificed too much to let this fall apart.</dd>
<dd><b>Jim Raynor</b>: You mean like you sacrificed Kerrigan?</dd>
<dd><b>Arcturus Mengsk</b>: You'll regret that. You don't seem to realize my situation here. I will <i>not be stopped</i>. Not by you, or the Confederates, or the Protoss, or <i>anyone</i>! I will <i>rule</i> this sector or see it burnt to <i>ashes</i> around me! If you try to get in my way—</dd>
<dd><b>Adjutant</b>: The fleet is prepped and ready, commander. Awaiting orders.</dd>
<dd><b>Jim Raynor</b>: The hell with him. We're gone.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Arcturus Mengsk</b>: Fellow Terrans, I come to you in the 
wake of recent events to issue a call to reason. Let no human deny the 
perils of our time. While we battle one another, divided by the petty 
strife of our common history, the tide of a greater conflict is turning 
against us, threatening to destroy all that we have accomplished. It is 
time for us as nations and as individuals to set aside our long-standing
 feuds and <i>unite</i>. The tides of an unwinnable war are upon us, and we must seek refuge upon higher ground, lest we be swept away by the flood.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The Confederacy is no more! Whatever semblance of unity and 
protection it once provided is a phantom, a memory. With our enemies 
left unchecked, who will you turn to for protection? The devastation 
wrought by the alien invaders is self-evident. We have seen our homes 
and communities destroyed by the calculated blows of the Protoss. We 
have seen first hand our friends and loved ones consumed by the 
nightmarish Zerg. Unprecedented and unimaginable though they may be, 
these are the signs of our time.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The time has come, my fellow Terrans, to rally to a new banner. 
In unity lies strength; already many of the dissident factions have 
joined us.  Out of the many we shall forge an indivisible whole 
capitulating only to a single throne, and from that throne <i>I</i> 
shall watch over you. From this day forward let no human make war upon 
any other human, let no Terran agency conspire against this new 
beginning, and let no man consort with alien powers, and to all the 
enemies of humanity: seek not to bar our way, for we shall win through, 
no matter the cost!</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zerg_Overmind" class="extiw" title="w:Zerg Overmind">The Overmind</a></b>:
 Awaken, my child, and embrace the glory that is your birthright. Know 
that I am the Overmind, the eternal will of the Swarm, and that you have
 been created to serve me.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zerg_Overmind" class="extiw" title="w:Zerg Overmind">The Overmind</a></b>: Arise, my daughter. Arise... Kerrigan.</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: By your will, father, I live to serve. Let all those who oppose the Overmind feel the wrath of the Swarm!</dd>
<dd><b>The Overmind</b>: Well done, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cerebrate" class="extiw" title="w:cerebrate">cerebrate</a>! What I have wrought this day shall be the undoing of my enemies. Let not a Terran survive!</dd>
<dd><b>Jim Raynor</b>: Mother of God... Kerrigan, what have they done to you? Sarah, is that really you?</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: To an extent. I'm far more than I once was, Jim. You shouldn't have come here.</dd>
<dd><b>Jim Raynor</b>: But, the dreams. I dreamed you were still alive, that somehow, you were... calling to me...</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: I was. While I was in the chrysalis, I 
instinctively reached out to you and Arcturus telepathically. 
Apparently, Arcturus sent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Duke_(StarCraft)" class="extiw" title="w:Edmund Duke (StarCraft)">Duke</a> here to reclaim me. But that was then, Jim. I am one of the Zerg now, and I like what I am. You can't imagine how this feels.</dd>
<dd><b>Jim Raynor</b>: So? What? Are you goin' to kill me now, darlin'?</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: It is certainly within my power, but you're 
not a threat to me, Jim. Be smart; leave here now and never seek to 
confront the Zerg again.</dd>
<dd><b>Jim Raynor</b>: Doesn't look like I have much choice.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>The Overmind</b>: Now shall the events set into motion so long ago be made complete. For the Protoss, too, were created by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xel%27Naga" class="extiw" title="w:Xel'Naga">Xel'Naga</a>.
 They were the first creation, gifted with a purity of form. And we were
 the second creation, blessed with a purity of essence. Indeed, our two 
species are but opposite facets of a greater whole. Soon shall our two 
races be made as one. Thenceforth shall all feel the wrath of the 
eternal Swarm... For the hour of judgement is come!</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldaris" class="extiw" title="w:Aldaris">Aldaris</a></b>: Ah, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tassadar" class="extiw" title="w:Tassadar">Tassadar</a>,
 have you fallen so far? To think that you were our brightest hope; our 
most beloved son. Now you are everything that we are not. You are lost 
to us. Not only have you damned yourself, but you have damned those who 
have followed you!</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Tassadar</b>: My friends, this is our final hour. Not all of 
us may survive the coming conflict. Yet, death may be a blessing should 
we fail here. We seek now to destroy a foe that has ravaged its way 
across the universe consuming all in its path. And now it has reached 
the end of its long journey. The Overmind has come to destroy all that 
we hold dear and assimilate us into itself. And I say to thee, this 
shall not come to pass! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiur" class="extiw" title="w:Aiur">Aiur</a> shall not fall! Executor, I stand ready!</dd>
<dd><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeratul" class="extiw" title="w:Zeratul">Zeratul</a></b>: As do I.</dd>
<dd><b>Jim Raynor</b>: Well, I guess all I have left is to see this 
through. The Zerg have taken everything from me: my home, my family, my 
friends. I know that nothing I do can bring those things back, but I'll 
be damned if I just sit on my hands and wait for the end. I want a piece
 of 'em, all right. I'm in.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Aldaris</b>: Executor, Tassadar... This comes too late to 
you, but the conclave has witnessed your defeat of the cerebrate. They 
know now that they cannot deny the necessity or the valiancy of your 
actions. We sought to punish you, while it was we who were in error. <b>You represent what is greatest in us all, and all our hopes go with you.  En Taro Adun, brave sons of Aiur!</b></dd>
<dd><b>Jim Raynor</b>: Wow. Does that mean they're gonna send some backup for us?</dd></dl>

<dd><b>Alexei Stukov</b>: I know all about the Zerg, Gerard. We've all seen the tapes a hundred-</dd>
<dd><b>Gerard DuGalle</b>: <i>[grasps Stukov's shoulder, knocking the cigar out of his mouth]</i>
 You've seen nothing! Dissecting a dead Zerg in a lab is one thing; 
unleashing them on men is another! You must go into this with both eyes 
open. Once started, there is no going back. <i>[stomps Stukov's cigar out]</i> Are you prepared to go all the way with this, Alexei?</dd>
<dd><b>Alexei Stukov</b>: <i>[looks down, then pulls a fresh cigar out of his coat]</i> Yes... yes, I am prepared to go all the way, my good admiral.</dd>

<dd><b>Zeratul</b>: It is finished, Judicator. Surrender your remaining forces, and join us in eradicating the Zerg.</dd>
<dd><b>Aldaris</b>: I would sooner die, dark one, than tarnish the memory of Aiur by joining with you!</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Edmund Duke</b>: Well now, I don't know which militia you all are from, but I advise you all to back down <i>now</i>!
 I'm General Edmund Duke of the Dominion Armada. And in the name of 
Emperor Mengsk, I order you to surrender your forces immediately and 
unconditionally.</dd>
<dd><b>Alexei Stukov</b>: Ah, General Duke. I had expected your forces 
to arrive sooner. You must know that we do not represent one of your 
rag-tag peasant militias, but the combined might of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Earth_Directorate" class="extiw" title="w:United Earth Directorate">United Earth Directorate</a>.</dd>
<dd><b>Edmund Duke</b>: Earth Directorate!? Er... You mean to tell me that you came all the way out here from Earth?</dd>
<dd><b>Alexei Stukov</b>: That is correct, General. We have been sent here to take control of this sector for the betterment of mankind.</dd>
<dd><b>Edmund Duke</b>: Over my dead body... I don't care where you're 
from, son, no one pushes around the Terran Dominion on my watch! All

<dd><b>Gerard DuGalle</b>: Duran! You son of a bitch, what's the meaning of this?!</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: Admiral DuGalle, I've heard a lot about you.</dd>
<dd><b>Gerard DuGalle</b>: Who the... <i>what</i> the hell are you?</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: I am Kerrigan. The Zerg you have killed here,
 and the Overmind which you've come to collect, are mine. As is our 
mutual friend Lieutenant Duran. You see, Admiral, there are several 
groups in this sector who feel your presence here causes certain... 
complications. I am here to make sure your reign is short-lived.</dd>
<dd><b>Gerard DuGalle</b>: You may find that difficult, you abomination, seeing as how I have the means to disrupt your control of the Zerg.</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan:</b> Ah yes, you're referring to your vaunted psi

<dd><b>Arcturus Mengsk</b>: Kerrigan, you murdering bitch! We had a deal.</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: Oh, come on, Arcturus. Did you really think 
that I would allow you to come into power again? You practically fed me 
to the Zerg on Tarsonis, you're directly responsible for the hell I've 
been through. Did you honestly think that I would let you get away with 
that?</dd>
<dd><b>Arcturus Mengsk</b>: But you said revenge was secondary to defeating the UED!</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: I lied. I liberated this planet because it 
was the UED's primary staging point, not because I was under any 
obligation to you. I used you to destroy the psi disrupter and now that 
I've got my broods back, you're no longer necessary for my plans. I 
think I'll leave you here, Arcturus, among the ashes of your precious 
Dominion. I want you to live to see me rise to power and I want you to 
always remember, in your most private moments, that it was you who let 
me loose in the first place.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenix_(StarCraft)" class="extiw" title="w:Fenix (StarCraft)">Fenix</a></b>: This is a betrayal most foul, Kerrigan. We were fools to have gone along with this charade!</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: You're right, Fenix. I used you to get the 
job done, and you played along just like I knew you would. You Protoss 
are all so headstrong and predictable. You are your own worst enemies.</dd>
<dd><b>Fenix</b>: That's ironic. I can remember Tassadar teaching you a very similar lesson on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Char_(StarCraft)" class="extiw" title="w:Char (StarCraft)">Char</a>.</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: I took that lesson to heart, Praetor. Now, are you prepared to die a second time?</dd>
<dd><b>Fenix</b>: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khala" class="extiw" title="w:Khala">Khala</a> awaits me, Kerrigan, and though I am prepared to face my destiny, you will not find me easy prey.</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: Then that shall be your epitaph.</dd>

<dd><b>Jim Raynor</b>: Fenix! No!</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: What are you worried about, Jim? He died the way all Protoss hope to: in combat!</dd>
<dd><b>Jim Raynor</b>: He died because you betrayed him! How many more 
noble souls do you need to consume before you're satisfied?! How many 
more innocent people have to die before you realize what you've become?!</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: You don't even know what you're talking about, Jim.</dd>
<dd><b>Jim Raynor</b>: Don't I? I'll see you dead for this, Kerrigan! 
For Fenix, and all the others who got caught between you and your mad 
quest for power!</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: Tough talk, Jimmy, but I don't think you have what it takes to be a killer.</dd>
<dd><b>Jim Raynor</b>: It may not be tomorrow, darlin', it may not even 
happen with an army at my back. But rest assured: I'm the man who's 
gonna kill you one day! I'll be seeing you!</dd>
<dd><b>Kerrigan</b>: It is done, Cerebrate. They've all been destroyed. 
Let us return to Tarsonis to rest. For the first time since my 
transfiguration I am... wearied of the slaughter.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: I can hardly believe this! You've killed your own matriarch!</dd>
<dd><b>Zeratul</b>: Better that I killed her than let her live as your slave, Kerrigan.</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b> Well, I have misjudged you, warrior. You are worthy indeed. You are free to go.</dd>
<dd><b>Zeratul</b>: What?</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: I said you are free to go. I've already taken
 your honor. I'll let you live because I know that from now on your 
every waking moment will be torture. You'll never be able to forgive 
yourself for what I've forced you to do. And that, Zeratul, is a better 
revenge than I could have ever dreamed of.</dd>
<dd><b>Zeratul</b>: You will regret this decision, Kerrigan. We shall meet again.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Samir Duran</b>: I am a servant of a far greater power: a 
power that has slept for countless ages, and is reflected in the 
creature within that cell.</dd>
<dd><b>Zeratul</b>: Have you any conception of what you've created here? Do you have any idea what this... this hybrid is capable of?</dd>
<dd><b>Samir Duran</b>: Of course I do. This creature is the completion 
of a cycle. Its role in the cosmic order was preordained when the stars 
were young. Behold the culmination of your history.</dd>
<dd><b>Zeratul</b>: All I behold is an abomination.</dd>
<dd><b>Samir Duran</b>: Your violence, young prodigal, is typical. As is
 your inability to comprehend the greater scheme of things. You can 
destroy all of the specimens here; it will do you no good. For I have 
seeded the hybrid on many, many worlds. You will never find them all 
before they awaken. And when they do, your universe will be changed... 
forever.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan</b>: Once again, I stand atop the broken 
bodies of my enemies, victorious... but not unscarred. The Earth-borne 
Directorate has been destroyed, and the Overmind lies dead and trampled 
beneath the ashes of Char. As for my unlikely allies, I think that I 
shall allow them a reprieve... for in time I will seek to test their 
resolve, and their strengths. They will all be mine in the end, for I am
 the Queen of Blades! None shall ever dispute my rule again.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Gerard DuGalle</b>: Dearest Helena, by now the news of our 
defeat has reached the Earth. The creatures we were sent here to tame 
are untameable, and the colonies we were sent here to reclaim have 
proven to be stronger than we anticipated. Whatever you may hear about 
what has happened out here, know this: Alexei did not die gloriously in 
battle. <i>I</i> killed him - my pride killed him. And now my pride has 
consumed me as well. You will never see me again, Helena. Tell our 
children that I love them, and that their father died in defense of 
their future. Au revoir.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Mengsk:</b> Jim Raynor represents a clear and present threat 
to this Dominion.  He is an unscrupulous, lawless, revolutionary bent on
 spreading fear and dissension across the sector.  He and his rag-tag

<dd><b>Raynor:</b> I'm guessing you're about to tell me.</dd>

 back with his one good arm.  It raises its arm to gore him... then its

as she tries to attack with them. Kerrigan tries to channel psionic 
energy, but the hybrid grabs her, smashes her several times into the 
floor, and then tosses her across the room. Artanis, having stood back 
and watched throughout, levels the tip of his warp blade at Kerrigan, 
then charges at the hybrid, blinking out of its path and severing its 
appendages while Kerrigan channels primal energy to heal her broken 
wings. Just as the hybrid grasps Artanis, Kerrigan impales it with her 
wings and lifts it off the ground, then - with an enraged scream - tears
 the hybrid in half.</i></dd>

<dd><b>Vorazun</b>: <i>You think us fools!?</i></dd>
<dd><b>Alarak</b>: Yes, but that is irrelevant.  What is relevant is 
that Amon has opened a gateway to the Void.  Dark energies pour from 
within, and they will consume your precious leader, and any who oppose 
Amon.  I can guide you to Artanis before this fate befalls him; if we 
are bold, we can stop the Dark God's assault.</dd>
<dd><b>Vorazun</b>: <i>[As she slowly picks her warp scythe up]</i> Am I to believe that the moment you are released, your blade will not be in my back?</dd>
<dd><b>Alarak</b>: You waste time. <i>[Breaks out of the stasis field in a burst of psionic energy, as warriors come to support Vorazun.]</i> Lower your blades.

<dd><b>Alarak</b>:  Oh, that's <i>hardly</i> a way to speak of one whom saved your master's life...</dd>
<dd><b>Artanis</b>:  <i>[dryly]</i> You care little for my survival, Alarak.  What is the true reason you've come to me?</dd>
<dd><b>Alarak</b>:  Our god broke his ancient covenant... and cast us low.</dd>
<dd><b>Fenix</b>:  These are lies, Artanis!</dd>
<dd><b>Alarak</b>:  <i>[shrugs]</i> I am the liar?  Are you not but a lie incarnate, <i>Machine Protoss</i>?</dd>
<dd><b>Artanis</b>:  Speak your piece, Alarak.</dd>
<dd><b>Alarak</b>:  The Tal'Darim death fleet amasses at Slayn, awaiting
 the start of a full scale invasion.  I come with an offer - You will

<dd><b>Artanis</b>:  I am going to make this clear:  <b>The Templar are not a weapon you can wield as you wish!</b>  We are not here to slay your enemies under false pretenses!  Deceive me again, and this "alliance" of ours comes to an end!</dd>
<dd><b>Alarak</b>:  <i>[As he consumes an orb of Terrazine gas]</i>  
Slaying Ma'lash's guardians fulfilled more than one purpose - Once the 
Highlord lies dead at my feet, none will challenge my rule.  <i>[Clearly altered, walking around Artanis like a vulture]</i>  After all these years, my victory is nearly at hand...  I feel his concern, Artanis, he <i>knows</i> that I'm coming for him...</dd>

<dd><b>Alarak</b>:  No.  <i>Amon.</i>  Through the Breath of Creation, I peer through the veil. <i>[Delighted]</i>  Oh, yes, I feel his rage <i>washing</i>
 over me, he knows I no longer fear him, he knows that the Tal'Darim

him...</dd>
<dd><b>Artanis</b>:  <i>[Warning]</i>  Do not assume you are already 
victorious, Alarak.  Do not let the Terrazine cloud your judgment.  You 
have a battle to win first!</dd>

<dd><i>[The Tal'Darim roar upwards in war cry.  Afterwards, in the Spear of Adun, he reunites with Artanis.]</i></dd>
<dd><b>Artanis</b>:  Alarak.</dd>
<dd><b>Alarak</b>:  The Tal'Darim have yielded to my authority and the 
death fleet is under my command.  I will use them both to avenge Amon's 
betrayal.</dd>
<dd><b>Artanis</b>:  Do your people believe in this cause, as you do?</dd>
<dd><b>Alarak</b>:  What they believe is of little consequence.  What matters is that they <i>obey.</i></dd></dl>

kind, but forge a powerful alliance.</dd>
<dd><b>Alarak</b>:  <i>Can we now?</i>  My people are <i>vastly</i> different than yours, Hierarch...</dd>
<dd><b>Artanis</b>:  We both desire vengeance, and we are both Protoss.  Is that not enough?</dd>
<dd><b>Alarak</b>:  Hmm, very well.  Submit to my absolute authority, <i>and we may indeed unite our forces...</i></dd></dl>
<p><i>[Artanis faces him, clearly offended at the defiance]</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Artanis</b>:  <i>Do not test me, Tal'Darim!</i>  Amon is a mighty foe, your people cannot hope to stand against him.  You <i>will</i> side with me, and together we will send him back to the abyss!</dd>
<dd><b>Alarak</b>:  <i>[Chuckles]</i>  So you *do* understand my culture, after all!  Let us say that, for now, <i>we have struck another bargain...</i></dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><i>[Artanis addresses the combined forces of Templar, Nerazim, 
Tal'Darim, and Purifiers under his command before the final strike 
against Amon's new host form on the surface of Aiur.]</i></dd>
<dd><b>Artanis</b>: My brethren, hear me, for there is little time left.
 All that remains of our race, our civilization, are those that stand 
beside you now... and those corrupted on the surface below. Our kind 
once stood as stewards of a galaxy full of promise. In our pride and 
division, we failed that sacred charge, and fell into ruin. The Khala, 
designed to bring unity, ultimately only aided those divisions. Its hope
 was a lie. Today, that lie must come to its end, and with it, our 
prejudice and arrogance must become a thing of the past. For now we 
fight for the belief that our kind has not seen its end; that we Protoss
 can stand bound by a belief in unity; and that we Protoss will forge a 
great and mighty new civilization! Trust each other in the fight ahead! 
Strike as one will! Let our last stand burn a memory so bright that we 
will be known throughout eternity!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><i>[Artanis addresses his army on the battlefield.]</i></dd>
<dd><b>Artanis</b>: Amon will bring the full might of the Great Fleet to
 bear against us, of that there is no doubt.  But we shall not break.  
We are the Daelaam, united as never before.  En taro Adun!  En taro 
Tassadar!  En taro Zeratul!</dd></dl>

out through the nerve cords of the corrupted warriors; Amon lets out a

<dd><b>Raynor</b>: She ain't gonna stand us up, Selendis. If she says it's important, you'd better believe it is.</dd>
<dd><b>Selendis</b>: Trusting this deceiver is not an act I am accustomed to, Commander.</dd>

<dd><b>Kerrigan</b>: Such little faith for a Templar. <i>[looks over at the others]</i> Artanis... Jim.</dd>
<dd><b>Raynor</b>: So what's goin' on, Sarah? What's so urgent, you got us all here for?</dd>
<dd><b>Kerrigan</b>: Amon lives. His hatred festers in the Void... and he already plans to return. Even now, I hear a voice calling me...</dd>
<dd><b>Selendis</b>: This may be the Great Enemy's trickery.</dd>
<dd><b>Kerrigan</b>: This voice is not his. There's something else in 
there. Something tormented and desperate... but it's benevolent. Amon's 
strength grows by the moment. He may not return during our lives, but he
 <i>will</i> return.</dd>
<dd><b>Artanis</b>: And what is it you suggest we do, Kerrigan?</dd>
<dd><b>Kerrigan</b>: There is a gateway to the Void within Ulnar. I intend to go through it and destroy the Fallen One once and for all.</dd>
<dd><i>[Selendis glances uncertainly at Artanis. Raynor studies the hologram, and comes to his own decision.]</i></dd>
<dd><b>Raynor</b>: Sarah's right. We can't kick this can down the road; this burden is ours, like it or not.</dd>

 my psionic extension into the minds of primitive beings.</dd>

<dd><b>Ouros</b>: The Cycle must not be broken. The merging of purity of
 essence and purity of form must continue. You, the one called Kerrigan,

<dl><dd><b>Aaren Ruth</b>: It looks like we've finally found a new place to call home. This planet where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dark_templar" class="extiw" title="w:dark templar">dark templar</a>
 have set up shop is very strange, though. I can get over the fact that 
everything here is blue—in fact, it's actually kind of relaxing, 
sometimes. No, the true surrealism of this place is that I have never 
seen a single plant! No grass, no trees, not even a single bush to break
 up the landscape. All they do seem to have are lots and lots of rocks. 
It's damn odd...</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Ronald Jackson</b>: I used to think that defeating the Zerg 
would take precise military maneuvers, clever tactics and strong 
leadership. I was wrong. You can't out-think the Swarm, you can't 
out-maneuver the Swarm, and you certainly can't break the morale of the 
Swarm. I hate to admit this, but I could do my job just as well if I 
ordered all my men to simply shoot anything that moves.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Aaren Ruth</b>: A funny thing happened today. I watched a 
Protoss templar doing what he calls "exercises." I was immediately taken
 back to the birthday party my mother gave me when I turned six years 
old. All my friends were there and there was more ice cream and cake 
than I could ever have thought possible. The highlight of the day, 
though, was the magician my mother hired as entertainment. He pulled a 
rabbit out of his black top hat and materialized coins out from behind 
the ears of my friends and, for a brief moment, I believed that magic 
was real. As an adult, I discovered the magic tricks that had transfixed
 me as a youth were just bits of misdirection and sleight of hand. I 
even learned a few of them to show my younger brothers and sisters. They
 loved those tricks, and I just wish they could see the Protoss. The

<dl><dd><b>Michael Daniel Liberty:</b> I'm Michael Daniel Liberty. I'm a
 reporter. Call this my most important, perhaps final, report. Call this
 my manifesto. Call it what you will. I'm just here to tell you what 
really happened. I'm here to set the record straight. I'm here to tell 
you the truth.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Michael Liberty:</b> And where did we get the name 'Protoss' Colonel? Is that ours, or theirs?</dd>
<dd><b>Colonel Edmund Duke:</b> Mister Liberty!</dd>
<dd><b>Mike:</b> And if it's their name for themselves, how come we know
 it? Didn't we have to know it in advance? Or did they send a warning 
before they were attacked?</dd>
<dd><b>Colonel Duke:</b> Lieutenant Swallow!</dd>
<dd><b>Lieutenant Swallow:</b> Yes, sir?</dd>
<dd><b>Colonel Duke:</b> Escort Mr. Liberty off the bridge! Now!</dd>
<dd><b>Mike:</b> Damnit, Duke, you know more than you're telling. This stinks to high heaven!</dd>
<dd><b>Colonel Duke:</b> I said now, Lieutenant!</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Michael Liberty:</b> All I know is what I saw. And what I saw
 was whatever they are, they liquefied the surface of the planet next 
door, and could be here faster than the Confederacy could react. And 
we're here at ground zero, playing cards.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Michael Liberty:</b> It's okay. You got them all.</dd>
<dd><b>Sarah Kerrigan:</b> I know. I got them all. And as I killed each 
and every one of them, I knew what they were thinking, Fear. Panic. 
Hatred. Hopelessness. Breakfast.</dd>
<dd><b>Mike:</b> Breakfast?</dd>
<dd><b>Kerrigan:</b> One of the techs had skipped breakfast, and he was 
really regretting not having had waffles. He was about to have his 
throat slit, and he was worried about waffles. It sucks being a 
telepath.</dd>
<dd><b>Mike:</b> I'll bet.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Michael Liberty:</b> But the emitter will only amplify. You need a telepath to...Kerrigan. You're going to use Kerrigan to bring in the Zerg.</dd>
<dd><b>Arcturus Mengsk:</b> Very good.</dd>
<dd><b>Mike:</b> You can't do that! You want her to break into a Confederate camp? She'll never make it.</dd>
<dd><b>Mengsk:</b> I have a high degree of confidence in the lieutenant.</dd>
<dd><b>Mike:</b> You can't do that!</dd>
<dd><b>Mengsk:</b> You have your tense wrong. I gave the orders for the 
operation before we sat down for our first game. The good lieutenant 
should be picking up the emitter in the shops right about now. If you 
hurry, you can catch up with her.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Michael Liberty:</b> War is supposed to increase development.</dd>
<dd><b>Arcturus Mengsk:</b> Yes, but most people use the guns and armor 
analogy: one side gets a better gun, the other side gets better armor, 
which inspires a still better gun, and so on. The truth is that a better
 gun inspires a chemical counterweapon, which inspires a telepathic 
strike, which then brings about an artificial intelligence guiding the 
weapon. The pressure of war does bring about growth, but it is never the
 neat, linear growth that you learn about in the classroom.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>The Liberty Manifesto</b>: Let's not kid ourselves, we got 
our heads handed to us by the Zerg and the Protoss. Yes, they were like 
nothing we had ever seen before. Yes, their biology was different. Yes, 
their technology, or what we would call their technology was advanced 
than ours in dozens of areas. And of course, they were belligerent and 
aggressive in the extreme, they knew where we were, and they had the 
advantage of surprise. But (And this is a rather large but) we humans 
are about the most ornery cusses in the galaxy. We had been fighting 
among ourselves for as long as we’ve been in the sector, and we had 
honed our battle technologies to the point that they were equal in many 
ways. We had the advantage of interior lines of supply (that's military 
for "surrounded") and native terrain (that's military for "we're 
fighting them in our living rooms"). We could have taken them if we had 
gotten our act together. So what happened? The very thing that made us 
good warriors-the fact that we had fought among ourselves- also made us 
horrible at banding together in our hour of crisis. We could not unite 
under one banner or even form a coalition. In fact, every time there was
 a chance for that, one faction or another did something to enhance the 
advancement of their own political agenda over other factions. Often at 
the expense of the rest of humanity. I can't imagine the hive-minded 
Zerg or the glowing Protoss falling prey to such basic human drives as 
greed and power and raw pigheadedness. Of course, those are all basic 
human drives, and that's why nonhumans were cleaning our clocks.</dd></dl>
<hr width="50%">
<dl><dd><b>Michael Liberty:</b> That's it. That's the story of the fall 
of the Confederacy, of the Zerg and Protoss invasions, of the rise of 
Emperor Mengsk of the Terran Dominion. The battles are still being 
fought, planets are still dying, and most of the time, no one seems to 
know why. When I find that out, I'll get you that information, as well. 
I'm Michael Daniel Liberty, no longer of UNN. Now I'm a free man. And 
I'm done.</dd></dl>

<ul><li>The races of Starcraft are now renowned for their balance and 
distinctive features but all started as being influenced by other 
science fiction properties and tropes. The Terrans were conceived of as 
“outlaw cowboys,” who would have a clunky, heavy feel to them, Art 
Director Sam Didier explains. “We wanted our human race, the Terrans, to
 be a bit more of scoundrels, rather than the uptight and polished 
humans of most science fiction stories.” <br> The Protoss, in contrast, 
were meant to embody the trope of the little “gray aliens” you see in 
science-fiction films. They were designed to be the “most intelligent, 
advanced race in the game, but also the highest evolved warriors,” 
Didier explains. These “little gray aliens” ended up being seven feet 
tall and  resembling “space samurai” where everything— their buildings, 
units, and armor— all were “ aesthetically pleasing to the eye.” <br> 
The Zerg, finally, were always meant to be these frighteningly adaptive 
aliens that were heavily influenced by Aliens and Robert A. Heinlein’s 
Starship Troopers. “They devoured and consumed and then took what was 
special about you and made it a part of their race. Oh, and they had 
teeth…lots of teeth,” Didier says.

<ul><li>StarCraft, a video game, is often compared to chess: it is 
strategic and extremely difficult, requiring a mathematical cast of 
mind, and, unlike many other video games, with their scrolling or 
first-person vantages, it affords a bird’s-eye perspective of the board,
 or map. But the analogy breaks down in countless ways. The map changes 
from game to game. (In this instance, it was called Habitation Station, 
and shaped somewhat like a butterfly.) Instead of black or white, 
players choose from among three “races,” called Zerg, Terran, and 
Protoss, with different strengths and vulnerabilities. In the early 
stages, players cannot see one another’s armies, and must dispatch 
scouts to illuminate darkened corners; they must also develop economies,
 with which to fund the inevitable battles. It’s as if Garry Kasparov 
had to plot a pawnless endgame while simultaneously harvesting minerals,
 building fuel extractors, and searching in vain for Spassky’s queen. 
Academic researchers now use StarCraft II—the “drosophila” of brain 
science, as one paper suggested—when studying people who expertly 
perform cognitively complex tasks. Chess may soon be eclipsed as the 
standard-bearer of competitive I.Q. <br> “Imagine playing a concerto on a
 piano, and if you miss one note the entire orchestra stops playing and 
you’re kicked off and you lose your job,” Sean Plott, one of the 
official commentators on the Scarlett-Bomber match, told me recently. 
“That’s what this is like.” The piano reference was not arbitrary; 
top-level StarCraft requires as many as three hundred actions per 
minute, or A.P.M.; an élite practitioner’s left hand, as it manipulates 
the keyboard, can appear almost to be playing Chopin. The right hand, 
meanwhile, darts and clicks with a mouse, contrapuntally, so frantic 
that carpal-tunnel syndrome and tendinitis are common side effects.

<ul><li>The rest of the team was like, ‘I dunno man, space vampires are pretty wack. We want to do something a little broader.</li>
<li>I grew up reading a lot of Thor — which has a Shakespearean 
component to the language — back from those Stan Lee days, or the Walt 
Simonson days, my favorite. I gave the Zerg campaign a Shakespeare meets
 Old Testament kind of vibe. But I needed that that human-like character
 down the line, and it was toward the end of the Terran campaign like, 
whoa, what if she becomes — again, we stumbled on those connector 
points.</li>
<li>At the time it was the big figure-skating to-do with Tonya Harding 
and Nancy Kerrigan. So we’ll just name ours Kerrigan, after the girl who
 gets her knee beat in. We thought, aw, that’s so funny! It’s so stupid.

<ul><li>At its peak, in Korea, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports" class="extiw" title="w:Esports">w:Esports</a>
 grew and led the world, there were three cable channels broadcasting 
StarCraft 24/7. That was both awesome and something that we hadn’t 
necessarily predicted, forecast.
