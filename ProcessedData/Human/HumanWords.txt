Good
day
,
magistrate
.
My
name
is
Arcturus
Mengsk
,
and
I
represent
the
Sons
of
Korhal
.
You
're
familiar
with
the
Confederate
propaganda
surrounding
my
group
,
but
your
reputation
suggests
you
'll
see
past
it
.
It
's
never
been
our
practice
to
operate
in
any
one
place
for
long
,
but
these
Zerg
do
n't
look
like
they
're
going
to
wait
.
I
'm
going
to
make
you
an
offer
,
magistrate
.
I
'd
like
to
help
you
out
by
sending
down
a
number
of
transports
to
your
colony
and
evacuating
any
survivors
.
You
know
,
of
course
,
that
my
organization
operates
outside
the
bounds
of
Confederate
law
.
That
's
why
they
spread
their
lies
and
misinformation
.
If
you
decide
to
accept
our
help
,
you
'll
be
branded
as
an
outlaw
too
.
But
,
it
's
a
chance
to
save
those
people
.
Time
to
make
a
stand
,
magistrate
.
I
'm
having
doubts
about
this
,
Arcturus
.
I
just
do
n't
think
anyone
deserves
to
have
the
zerg
unleashed
on
them
.
I
know
you
have
personal
feelings
about
this
.
But
you
ca
n't
let
your
past
cloud
your
judgement
.
Carry
out
your
orders
,
Lieutenant
.
Yes
,
sir
.
Psi
Emitter
in
place
.
Just
promise
me
we
'll
never
do
anything
like
this
again
.
We
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
save
humanity
.
Our
responsibility
is
too
great
to
do
anything
less
.
Why
are
you
doing
this
,
Kerrigan
?
Look
,
I
know
about
your
past
,
I
mean
I
've
heard
the
rumors
.
I
know
you
were
part
of
those
experiments
with
the
Zerg
,
that
Mengsk
came
and
saved
you
.
But
you
do
n't
owe
him
this
.
Hell
...
I
've
saved
your
butt
plenty
of
times
.
Jimmy
,
drop
the
knight
in
shining
armor
routine
.
It
suits
you
sometimes
,
just
...
not
now
.
I
do
n't
need
to
be
rescued
.
I
know
what
I
'm
doing
.
The
Protoss
are
coming
to
destroy
the
entire
planet
,
not
just
the
Zerg
.
I
know
that
because
...
well
,
I
just
know
it
.
I
am
a
ghost
,
remember
?
Once
we
dealt
with
the
Protoss
,
we
can
do
something
about
the
Zerg
.
Arcturus
'll
come
around
.
I
know
he
will
.
I
hope
you
're
right
,
darling
.
Good
huntin
'
!
Gentlemen
,
you
've
done
very
well
,
but
remember
that
we
've
still
got
a
job
to
do
.
The
seeds
of
a
new
Empire
have
been
sown
,
and
if
we
hope
to
reap—
Ah
,
to
hell
with
you
!
You
're
making
a
terrible
mistake
.
Do
n't
even
think
to
cross
me
!
I
've
sacrificed
too
much
to
let
this
fall
apart
.
You
mean
like
you
sacrificed
Kerrigan
?
You
'll
regret
that
.
You
do
n't
seem
to
realize
my
situation
here
.
I
will
not
be
stopped
.
Not
by
you
,
or
the
Confederates
,
or
the
Protoss
,
or
anyone
!
I
will
rule
this
sector
or
see
it
burnt
to
ashes
around
me
!
If
you
try
to
get
in
my
way—
The
fleet
is
prepped
and
ready
,
commander
.
Awaiting
orders
.
The
hell
with
him
.
We
're
gone
.
Fellow
Terrans
,
I
come
to
you
in
the
wake
of
recent
events
to
issue
a
call
to
reason
.
Let
no
human
deny
the
perils
of
our
time
.
While
we
battle
one
another
,
divided
by
the
petty
strife
of
our
common
history
,
the
tide
of
a
greater
conflict
is
turning
against
us
,
threatening
to
destroy
all
that
we
have
accomplished
.
It
is
time
for
us
as
nations
and
as
individuals
to
set
aside
our
long-standing
feuds
and
unite
.
The
tides
of
an
unwinnable
war
are
upon
us
,
and
we
must
seek
refuge
upon
higher
ground
,
lest
we
be
swept
away
by
the
flood
.
By
your
will
,
father
,
I
live
to
serve
.
Let
all
those
who
oppose
the
Overmind
feel
the
wrath
of
the
Swarm
!
Mother
of
God
...
Kerrigan
,
what
have
they
done
to
you
?
Sarah
,
is
that
really
you
?
To
an
extent
.
I
'm
far
more
than
I
once
was
,
Jim
.
You
should
n't
have
come
here
.
But
,
the
dreams
.
I
dreamed
you
were
still
alive
,
that
somehow
,
you
were
...
calling
to
me
...
I
was
.
While
I
was
in
the
chrysalis
,
I
instinctively
reached
out
to
you
and
Arcturus
telepathically
.
Apparently
,
Arcturus
sent
Duke
here
to
reclaim
me
.
But
that
was
then
,
Jim
.
I
am
one
of
the
Zerg
now
,
and
I
like
what
I
am
.
You
ca
n't
imagine
how
this
feels
.
So
?
What
?
Are
you
goin
'
to
kill
me
now
,
darlin
'
?
It
is
certainly
within
my
power
,
but
you
're
not
a
threat
to
me
,
Jim
.
Be
smart
;
leave
here
now
and
never
seek
to
confront
the
Zerg
again
.
Does
n't
look
like
I
have
much
choice
.
Wow
.
Does
that
mean
they
're
gon
na
send
some
backup
for
us
?
So
,
Gerard
...
I
suspect
you
have
a
good
reason
for
pulling
me
away
from
my
...
duties
.
Your
vodka
can
wait
,
my
good
Alexei
.
Come
,
stand
here
.
You
need
to
see
this
.
I
know
all
about
the
Zerg
,
Gerard
.
We
've
all
seen
the
tapes
a
hundred-
Are
you
prepared
to
go
all
the
way
with
this
,
Alexei
?
Yes
...
yes
,
I
am
prepared
to
go
all
the
way
,
my
good
admiral
.
Good
...
good
,
I
knew
I
could
count
on
you
.
Take
us
into
orbit
,
Mr.
Malmsteen
.
We
've
seen
enough
.
Well
now
,
I
do
n't
know
which
militia
you
all
are
from
,
but
I
advise
you
all
to
back
down
now
!
I
'm
General
Edmund
Duke
of
the
Dominion
Armada
.
And
in
the
name
of
Emperor
Mengsk
,
I
order
you
to
surrender
your
forces
immediately
and
unconditionally
.
Ah
,
General
Duke
.
I
had
expected
your
forces
to
arrive
sooner
.
You
must
know
that
we
do
not
represent
one
of
your
rag-tag
peasant
militias
,
but
the
combined
might
of
the
United
Earth
Directorate
.
Earth
Directorate
!
?
Er
...
You
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
came
all
the
way
out
here
from
Earth
?
That
is
correct
,
General
.
We
have
been
sent
here
to
take
control
of
this
sector
for
the
betterment
of
mankind
.
Over
my
dead
body
...
I
do
n't
care
where
you
're
from
,
son
,
no
one
pushes
around
the
Terran
Dominion
on
my
watch
!
All
units
,
fire
at
will
!
Duran
!
You
son
of
a
bitch
,
what
's
the
meaning
of
this
?
!
Admiral
DuGalle
,
I
've
heard
a
lot
about
you
.
Who
the
...
what
the
hell
are
you
?
I
am
Kerrigan
.
The
Zerg
you
have
killed
here
,
and
the
Overmind
which
you
've
come
to
collect
,
are
mine
.
As
is
our
mutual
friend
Lieutenant
Duran
.
You
see
,
Admiral
,
there
are
several
groups
in
this
sector
who
feel
your
presence
here
causes
certain
...
complications
.
I
am
here
to
make
sure
your
reign
is
short-lived
.
You
may
find
that
difficult
,
you
abomination
,
seeing
as
how
I
have
the
means
to
disrupt
your
control
of
the
Zerg
.
Ah
yes
,
you
're
referring
to
your
vaunted
psi
disruptor
.
It
wo
n't
last
you
forever
.
Sooner
or
later
,
I
'll
destroy
it
.
Then
I
'll
show
you
what
the
Zerg
are
really
capable
of
.
Oh
,
and
by
the
way
,
Admiral
,
your
friend
Stukov
was
twice
the
man
you
are
.
I
'm
glad
you
saved
me
the
trouble
of
killing
him
.
Do
your
worst
,
then
,
girl
.
You
ai
n't
takin
'
Edmund
Duke
without
a
fight
.
Kerrigan
,
you
murdering
bitch
!
We
had
a
deal
.
Oh
,
come
on
,
Arcturus
.
Did
you
really
think
that
I
would
allow
you
to
come
into
power
again
?
You
practically
fed
me
to
the
Zerg
on
Tarsonis
,
you
're
directly
responsible
for
the
hell
I
've
been
through
.
Did
you
honestly
think
that
I
would
let
you
get
away
with
that
?
But
you
said
revenge
was
secondary
to
defeating
the
UED
!
I
lied
.
I
liberated
this
planet
because
it
was
the
UED
's
primary
staging
point
,
not
because
I
was
under
any
obligation
to
you
.
I
used
you
to
destroy
the
psi
disrupter
and
now
that
I
've
got
my
broods
back
,
you
're
no
longer
necessary
for
my
plans
.
I
think
I
'll
leave
you
here
,
Arcturus
,
among
the
ashes
of
your
precious
Dominion
.
I
want
you
to
live
to
see
me
rise
to
power
and
I
want
you
to
always
remember
,
in
your
most
private
moments
,
that
it
was
you
who
let
me
loose
in
the
first
place
.
You
're
right
,
Fenix
.
I
used
you
to
get
the
job
done
,
and
you
played
along
just
like
I
knew
you
would
.
You
Protoss
are
all
so
headstrong
and
predictable
.
You
are
your
own
worst
enemies
.
I
took
that
lesson
to
heart
,
Praetor
.
Now
,
are
you
prepared
to
die
a
second
time
?
Then
that
shall
be
your
epitaph
.
Fenix
!
No
!
He
died
because
you
betrayed
him
!
How
many
more
noble
souls
do
you
need
to
consume
before
you
're
satisfied
?
!
How
many
more
innocent
people
have
to
die
before
you
realize
what
you
've
become
?
!
You
do
n't
even
know
what
you
're
talking
about
,
Jim
.
Do
n't
I
?
I
'll
see
you
dead
for
this
,
Kerrigan
!
For
Fenix
,
and
all
the
others
who
got
caught
between
you
and
your
mad
quest
for
power
!
Tough
talk
,
Jimmy
,
but
I
do
n't
think
you
have
what
it
takes
to
be
a
killer
.
It
is
done
,
Cerebrate
.
They
've
all
been
destroyed
.
Let
us
return
to
Tarsonis
to
rest
.
For
the
first
time
since
my
transfiguration
I
am
...
wearied
of
the
slaughter
.
I
can
hardly
believe
this
!
You
've
killed
your
own
matriarch
!
I
said
you
are
free
to
go
.
I
've
already
taken
your
honor
.
I
'll
let
you
live
because
I
know
that
from
now
on
your
every
waking
moment
will
be
torture
.
You
'll
never
be
able
to
forgive
yourself
for
what
I
've
forced
you
to
do
.
And
that
,
Zeratul
,
is
a
better
revenge
than
I
could
have
ever
dreamed
of
.
Once
again
,
I
stand
atop
the
broken
bodies
of
my
enemies
,
victorious
...
but
not
unscarred
.
The
Earth-borne
Directorate
has
been
destroyed
,
and
the
Overmind
lies
dead
and
trampled
beneath
the
ashes
of
Char
.
As
for
my
unlikely
allies
,
I
think
that
I
shall
allow
them
a
reprieve
...
for
in
time
I
will
seek
to
test
their
resolve
,
and
their
strengths
.
They
will
all
be
mine
in
the
end
,
for
I
am
the
Queen
of
Blades
!
None
shall
ever
dispute
my
rule
again
.
They
say
a
man
never
really
knows
himself
until
his
freedom
's
been
taken
away
.
I
wonder
,
how
well
do
you
know
yourself
?
Prisoner
,
step
forward
onto
the
platform
.
Convict
626
.
Murderer
.
Pirate
.
Traitor
.
Today
,
you
go
free
.
But
as
you
'll
soon
learn
,
even
freedom
has
a
price
.
Combat
suit
sealed
and
locked
.
You
'll
carry
your
prison
with
you
.
That
armor
will
be
your
new
cell
.
Make
no
mistake
.
War
is
coming
.
With
all
its
glory
,
and
all
its
horror
.
Mr.
Findlay
,
your
freedom
awaits
...
Hell
,
it
's
about
time
!
Jim
Raynor
represents
a
clear
and
present
threat
to
this
Dominion
.
He
is
an
unscrupulous
,
lawless
,
revolutionary
bent
on
spreading
fear
and
dissension
across
the
sector
.
He
and
his
rag-tag
band
of
miscreants
have
instigated
open
rebellion
across
the
sector
...
[
gets
blurred
as
Jim
focuses
his
attention
on
a
photo
of
Sarah
Kerrigan
]
...
I
assure
you
,
this
criminal
will
be
brought
to
justice
,
very
soon
.
Your
forces
are
prepared
,
and
awaiting
your
orders
,
Commander
.
Uploading
tactical
data
,
now
.
Good
.
'Bout
time
we
kicked
this
revolution
into
overdrive
.
You
know
,
for
the
most
wanted
man
in
the
sector
,
you
ai
n't
that
hard
to
find
.
I
had
to
see
it
for
myself
.
Little
Jimmy
Raynor
,
the
people
's
hero
.
Tychus
Findlay
.
Nice
suit
.
Pays
to
be
prepared
.
I
heard
they
put
you
on
ice
.
Life
sentence
.
What
,
they
give
you
time
off
for
good
behavior
?
That
's
right
,
old
buddy
.
I
'm
a
model
citizen
now
.
So
to
what
do
I
owe
the
pleasure
?
Just
a
friendly
business
proposition
.
Do
you
even
know
what
the
Dominion
are
doing
out
here
?
I
'm
guessing
you
're
about
to
tell
me
.
Digging
up
alien
artifacts
,
old
buddy
.
Your
boy
Mengsk
has
gone
crazy
for
them
.
But
I
got
a
contact
that
will
pay
top
dollar
for
every
artifact
we
...
liberate
from
the
Dominion
.
I
guess
I
can
hardly
pass
that
up
now
,
can
I
,
Tychus
?
Partners
then
.
60-40
.
70-30
.
My
way
.
[
chuckles
]
Feels
like
old
times
already
.
Old
times
.
Damn
,
Jimmy
,
you
've
been
holdin
'
out
on
me
.
Cuttin
'
it
pretty
close
there
,
Matt
.
Never
left
you
hanging
before
,
sir
.
Fair
enough
.
Just
get
us
the
hell
out
of
here
.
All
batteries
,
concentrate
forward
firepower
.
Spin
up
drives
two
and
six
.
All
hands
,
brace
for
warp
jump
on
my
mark
...
Mark
!
What
the
hell
happened
?
We
ai
n't
seen
the
Zerg
in
years
.
Why
attack
Mar
Sara
now
?
It
's
not
just
Mar
Sara
.
You
need
to
see
this
.
The
Zerg
Swarm
launched
a
full-scale
attack
--
Devastation
spread
throughout
all
outer
rim
planets
--
--
sustained
heavy
losses
--
Casualties
in
the
billions
.
Minutes
ago
,
the
Zerg
attacked
a
Dominion
military
research
facility
...
Sweet
mother
of
mercy
...
We
always
knew
she
'd
be
back
...
but
what
's
she
after
?
She
's
come
to
finish
the
job
.
I
've
been
cleaning
up
after
you
a
lot
lately
.
Leave
it
alone
,
Matt
.
Same
dream
?
I
said
,
leave
it
alone
.
What
happened
to
Kerrigan
was
n't
your
fault
.
Which
part
?
Where
she
got
left
behind
,
or
where
she
murdered
eight
billion
people
?
Man
,
do
you
even
see
what
you
're
becoming
?
We
are
who
we
choose
to
be
,
Matt
.
When
you
figure
it
out
,
let
us
know
.
We
're
waitin
'
on
ya
.
Turn
around
,
Arcturus
.
I
want
you
to
see
this
coming
.
You
wo
n't
find
my
father
here
,
Commander
.
[
lifts
the
needle
from
the
record
player

silencing
it

I
am
Valerian
Mengsk
...
and
I
own
the
Moebius
Foundation
.
Through
them
,
I
own
you
as
well
.
Tell
me
why
I
should
n't
kill
you
right
now
.
Because
I
can
offer
you
what
you
've
always
wanted
.
[
turns
to
face
him
]
A
chance
to
rescue
Sarah
Kerrigan
.
You
boys
got
ta
wake
up
!
Raynor
's
sold
us
out
!
I
joined
this
outfit
to
fight
the
Dominion
,
not
work
for
them
!
Everybody
simmer
down
!
We
trusted
the
Commander
before
,
we
should
trust
him
now
.
You
ca
n't
trust
that
drunk
.
Jim
Raynor
's
nothing
but
a
spineless
coward
.
You
've
been
nothing
but
poison
since
you
got
on
this
crate
.
[
turns
away
]
That
right
?
[
grabs
Swann
by
the
shirt
,
who
struggles
to
escape
]
Pathetic
.
Only
person
you
can
trust
is
yourself
.
As
soon
as
you
peons
figure
that
out-
Heard
about
enough
of
this
.
You
got
them
all
fooled
,
do
n't
you
,
Jimmy
?
But
the
first
sign
of
trouble
,
you
'll
just
duck
and
run
.
It
's
what
you
do
,
ai
n't
it
?
Me
.
Them
.
That
pretty
little
girlfriend
of
yours
.
Do
n't
do
something
you
're
gon
na
regret
,
Tychus
.
That
ai
n't
fair
...
You
think
he
's
right
?
I
'm
just
gon
na
run
out
on
you
?
You
got
us
working
for
the
Dominion
,
now
,
Commander
.
You
're
taking
us
back
to
Char
.
It
's
like
you
're
gone
already
.
This
ai
n't
about
the
Dominion
.
Our
war
has
always
been
about
saving
lives
.
If
the
Zerg
wipe
everyone
out
,
it
's
all
been
for
nothing
.
So
I
'm
going
back
to
Char
.
If
you
're
with
me
,
it
's
your
choice
.
Just
like
it
's
always
been
.
Now
that
's
the
Commander
I
've
been
waiting
on
!
Satisfied
?
Let
's
get
back
to
work
,
boys
.
I
do
n't
want
to
have
to
have
this
conversation
again
.
[
looks
over
at
his
ruined
jukebox
]
And
fix
my
damn
jukebox
!
[
walks
out
]
Uh
...
a
little
help
here
?
Anybody
...
?
Char
.
If
Hell
ever
existed
,
this
is
it
.
Oceans
of
fire
,
tectonic
storms
,
and
an
atmosphere
that
'll
burn
a
man
alive
.
But
we
've
planned
for
all
of
that
.
You
ca
n't
plan
for
the
Zerg
,
General
!
They
ai
n't
gon
na
fit
into
your
nice
clean
time
table
!
I
've
led
five
separate
invasions
against
the
Swarm
!
I
held
the
line
while
you
and
your
terrorist
friends
hid
under
a
rock-
We
're
all
aware
of
your
victories
,
General
.
I
've
invited
Commander
Raynor
here
to
assist
us
...
with
any
unforeseen
contingencies
.
Well
,
it
sounds
like
you
've
got
it
all
figured
out
,
Junior
.
I
've
invested
far
too
much
in
this
undertaking
to
see
it
fail
.
Speaking
of
which
,
you
may
particularly
enjoy
this
next
step
.
[
turns
on
a
holotransmission
of
Arcturus
Mengsk
]
Valerian
!
I
've
just
received
a
report
that
you
've
taken
half
of
the
fleet
!
Care
to
explain
yourself
,
boy
?
Father
,
I
am
about
to
accomplish
that
which
you
never
could
.
Today
I
will
defeat
the
Queen
of
Blades
,
and
secure
peace
throughout
the
Dominion
.
By
this
act
,
the
people
will
finally
know
that
I
am
a
worthy
successor
to
you
.
I
love
your
gumption
,
son
,
but
you
're
in
way
over
your
head
.
What
makes
you
think
you
have
the
experience
to-
He
ai
n't
alone
,
Arcturus
!
Raynor
.
I
do
n't
know
what
gutter
my
son
fished
you
out
of
,
but
even
you
've
got
to
realize
that
treacherous
bitch
can
not
be
saved
...
and
neither
can
you
.
We
'll
see
about
that
.
And
when
this
is
over
,
you
and
me
got
a
score
to
settle
.
Shit
!
[
He
deploys
his
rifle

bayonet
and
impales
a
zergling
leaping
at
him
,
then
has
to
leap
aside
to
avoid
being
strafed
by
a
trio
of
Mutalisks
.
]
Fall
back
!
We
're
cut
off
!
Belay
that
order
!
Stand
your
ground
!
Heard
you
boys
needed
some
help
.
We
came
as
fast
as
we
could
.
Ai
n't
no
time
to
be
lyin
'
down
on
the
job
,
General
.
You
magnificent
son
of
a
bitch
!
You
're
the
last
man
I
expected
to
see
!
Boys
,
I
hate
to
interrupt
,
but
,
uh
...
the
natives
are
getting
restless
.
Thanks
for
the
rescue
,
but
I
hope
it
ai
n't
just
the
two
of
you
.
General
,
you
know
I
've
always
got
a
card
to
play
.
You
might
be
a
damn
pirate
,
Raynor
,
but
whatever
happens
,
you
saved
my
boys
today
.
And
I
wo
n't
forget
that
.
All
in
a
day
's
work
,
General
.
The
Xel'Naga
artifact
's
been
assembled
.
I
hope
to
God
it
does
,
what
we
think
it
does
.
Damn
straight
.
Betting
our
asses
on
some
alien
piece
of
crap
do
n't
sit
right
with
me
.
I
hear
you
,
Tychus
,
but
if
I
was
banking
everything
on
that
,
I
'd
be
quit
already
.
'Cause
here
we
are
in
the
mouth
of
hell
,
and
we
made
it
this
far
by
leaning
on
each
other
.
Whether
it
's
blind
luck
,
or
damn
fool
courage
,
in
all
my
years
,
I
've
never
seen
anything
like
what
you
two
jokers
have
pulled
off
.
That
thing
may
be
the
key
to
stopping
the
Queen
of
Blades
.
[
Dominion
troops
turn
up
their
radios
,
as
Raynor
's
voice
is
heard
over
their
comm
channels
and
loudspeakers
]
But
it
's
our
sweat
and
blood
that
will
make
it
happen
.
After
everything
that
we
've
been
through
,
past
all
the
fire
and
fury
,
the
one
thing
I
know
is
that
we
can
count
on
each
other
to
get
the
job
done
.
Or
die
trying
,
if
that
's
what
it
takes
.
Because
some
things
are
just
worth
fighting
for
.
Do
n't
give
up
!
I
hear
Sarah
...
Zeratul
...
It
's
been
four
years
,
you
show
up
outta
nowhere
and-
Nice
to
see
you
too
...
Auir
...
What
was
he
looking
for
?
He
was
trying
to
find
out
why
the
Overmind
made
the
Queen
of
Blades
in
the
first
place
.
She
's
the
one
that
's
going
to
destroy
the
universe
?
No
,
that
's
just
it
...
I
think
she
's
the
only
one
that
can
save
it
.
Zerg
.
Protoss
.
These
are
strong
races
.
How
terrible
...
How
powerful
is
something
that
plays
with
their
fates
?
These
shocking
revelations-
Veritable
firestorm
of
anti-Mengsk
sentiment-
The
Emperor
held
a
news
conference
earlier
today
.
Emperor
,
how
do
you
respond
to
these
allegations
of
genocide
?
Of
using
aliens
to-
I
assure
you
,
these
slanderous
attacks
against
the
Throne
are
baseless
and
irresponsible
.
Sir
,
do
you
still
stand
by
the
sentiment
that
selfless
devotion
to
the
people
is
the
basis
of
your
rule
?
Well
,
of
course
!
I
was
called
upon
to
serve
the
greater
interest
of
humanity
.
Personal
power
was
never
my
goal
.
Than
how
would
you
characterize
...
this
statement
?
I
will
not
be
stopped
.
Not
by
you
,
or
the
Confederates
,
or
the
Protoss
,
or
anyone
!
I
will
RULE
this
sector
,
or
see
it
burn
to
ashes
around
me
!
I
...
I
wo
n't
stand
for
this
!
You
jackals
think
you
can
come
in
here
and
question
ME
?
!
This
interview
is
over
!
Fifty
years
,
and
no
one
's
ever
escaped
from
New
Folsom
...
but
we
broke
it
open
in
an
afternoon
.
I
can
hardly
believe
we
pulled
it
off
.
You
guys
did
good
.
Now
me
and
my
Spectres
'll
finish
the
job
.
We
'll
kill
Mengsk
...
and
burn
his
Dominion
to
the
ground
.
Overthrowing
Mengsk
is
just
the
start
.
This
is
about
building
a
better
tomorrow
.
[
brings
up
the
prisoner
manifest
]
Do
n't
you
see
?
We
just
released
every
scientist
,
philosopher
and
free-thinker
that
ever
challenged
Mengsk
's
rule
.
That
was
our
real
victory
today
.
You
really
that
naive
?
Tomorrow
,
there
'll
be
a
new
Mengsk
,
and
another
one
after
that
.
Your
great
shining
dream
of
the
future
is
just
an
illusion
.
So
if
it
's
all
so
bleak
,
why
are
you
here
,
Tosh
?
What
do
you
get
out
of
all
this
?
Same
thing
as
you
,
brother
.
I
do
n't
quit
'til
Mengsk
is
dead
.
Vengeance
does
n't
factor
into
this
.
Our
revolution
's
about
freedom
.
But
it
ai
n't
for
the
likes
of
us
.
Sarah
...
You
readin
'
all
this
?
You
have
your
orders
,
Mr.
Findlay
.
Carry
them
out
.
Tychus
...
what
have
you
done
?
I
made
a
deal
with
the
devil
,
Jimmy
.
She
dies
...
I
go
free
.
We
all
got
our
choices
to
make
.
[

Damn
shame
...
...
Jim
?
It
's
okay
.
I
gotcha
.
I
am
the
Swarm
.
Armies
will
be
shattered
.
Worlds
will
burn
.
Now
,
at
last
,
on
this
world
,
vengeance
shall
be
mine
...
...
for
I
am
the
Queen
of
Blades

Jim
?
Jim
...
where
's
Jim
?
We
...
could
n't
get
him
out

Valerian

Sarah
...
we
need
to
work
together
!
Do
what
you
want

I
'm
going
to
find
Jim
.
Jim
?
Are
you
on
this
frequency
?
Jim
,
are
you
out
there
?
I´m
at
the
rendezvous
,
it´s
all
clear
here
.
I
've
been
thinking
about
what
you
said
.
There´s
something
dark
in
me
,
Jim
...
I
need
you
.
I
need
you
to
hear
me
right
now
.
Proud
Dominion
citizens
,
at
long
last
our
nightmare
is
over
!
The
lawless
terrorist
Jim
Raynor
...
is
dead
!
With
his
death
comes
a
new
era
of
peace
...
The
protoss
have
retreated
from
our
Dominion
,
and
the
zerg
threat
has
been
removed
.
Their
Swarm
is
shattered
and
leaderless
.
Soon
we
will
eradicate
every
last
zerg
on
Char
.
In
short
,
we
have
won
.
Our
peace
and
security
is
assured
.
Good
night
,
my
faithful
subjects
.
Confirmed
.
It
's
bloody
.
Is
it
that
simple
?
Yes
.
And
if
I
let
you
live
,
you
'll
call
down
your
Golden
Armada
,
and
they
will
kill
me
.
I
justify
nothing
.
There
is
no
moral
high
ground
here
.
Your
people
have
killed
billions
of
Zerg
.
We
're
all
covered
in
blood
.
There
may
be
more
on
my
hands
than
yours
,
but
in
the
end
,
we
are
both
killers
.
Lieutenant
,
get
the
wounded
to
those
shuttles
.
We
're
almost
there
!
Should
I
send
a
team
to
get
you
?
I
'm
...
fine
,
Lieutenant
.
Just
see
to
those
wounded
.
I
'll
get
out
another
way
.
General
!
There
's
too
many
Zerg
!
We
're
not
gon
na
make
it
!
Kerrigan
.
You
listen
to
me
.
I
have
three
shuttles
packed
with
men
to
injured
to
ever
be
a
threat
to
you
.
Husbands
,
fathers
.
You
let
those
shuttles
go
.
You
hear
me
?
General
,
we
're
surrounded
.
There
's
no
way
out
!
You
bitch
.
You
're
not
even
human
anymore
.
You
betrayed
us
all
.
For
what
?
Petty
revenge
?
How
many
innocents
have
you
killed
?
How
many
more
have
to
die
?
What
if
Raynor
could
see
you
right
now
?
General
,
we
're
surrounded
!
We
're
not
gon
na
make
it
!
General
,
the
Zerg
pulled
back
.
It
's
a
miracle
!
We
're
going
to
make
it
!
General
!
...
General
?
Zeratul
.
What
do
you
want
?
!
Face
me
,
Narud
.
It
's
over
.
Your
god
is
dead
,
and
he
's
never
coming
back
.
No
...
Sarah
...
No
...
you
're
not
him
.
You
're
not
Jim
!
You
're
nothing
!
Sarah
?
[
realizes
that
Kerrigan
has
reverted
to
Zerg
form
]
No
...
I
had
to
get
you
out
.
What
have
you
done
?
What
I
...
had
to
.
Tell
that
to
Fenix
!
Tell
it
to
the
millions
you
butchered
!
You
swore
you
'd
kill
the
Queen
of
Blades
.
You
were
the
only
one
who
ever
believed
in
me
.
Do
you
still
...
believe
in
me
?
I
love
you
,
Jim
.
Never
forget
it
.
We
're
done
.
Jim
is
doing
well
.
He
's
in
the
med-bay
.
But
I
do
n't
think
he
wants
to
talk
to
anyb
...
I
'm
here
to
talk
to
you
,
Valerian
.
You
understand
that
I
'm
going
to
Korhal
soon
?
I
do
.
You
plan
to
kill
my
father
.
He
's
had
this
coming
for
a
long
time
.
I
need
to
know
where
you
stand
.
I
stand
for
my
people
.
I
've
accepted
that
my
father
is
beyond
redemption
,
and
must
be
removed
from
power
.
I
'm
glad
we
understand
each
other
.
I
'm
going
to
Korhal
.
It
's
time
.
Why
are
you
telling
us
this
,
Kerrigan
?
There
will
be
ruin
,
destruction
,
millions
could
die
amid
the
chaos
.
Valerian
,
your
people
will
need
a
leader
.
You
're
right
,
Kerrigan
,
they
will
.
If
I
am
to
be
that
leader
,
I
'll
ask
only
one
thing
of
you
.
Bring
your
Swarm
down
outside
the
city
.
That
will
give
us
time
to
evacuate
.
Korhal
is
going
to
be
the
most
difficult
battle
of
my
life
,
and
you
're
asking
me
to
make
it
harder
.
I
am
...
I
was
wrong
about
you
,
Valerian
.
You
're
not
like
your
father
.
I
'll
give
you
your
chance
.
Make
the
most
of
it
.
Hello
,
Kerrigan
.
I
've
been
waiting
for
you
.
I
'm
surprised
you
have
n't
tried
to
escape
.
Escape
?
[
chuckles
]
My
dear
,
I
'm
afraid
you
've
got
it
all
wrong
.
Really
.
Did
you
think
I
'd
keep
an
animal
like
you
close
to
me
without
some
kind
of
insurance
policy
?
[
gives
Kerrigan
another
jolt
]
Clearly
,
you
are
my
greatest
failure
.
Now
,
at
long
last
...
you
will
die
!
Change
of
plans
.
You
can
never
suffer
enough
for
all
the
lives
you
've
ruined
,
Arcturus
.
I
made
you
into
a
monster
,
Kerrigan
!
You
made
us
all
into
monsters
.
Thank
you
,
Jim
...
for
everything
.
My
pleasure

Always
was

Fate
ai
n't
written
,
Artanis
.
Way
I
see
it
,
if
Zeratul
believed
you
could
make
a
difference
in
all
this
,
then
this
fight
's
just
begun
.
Give
'em
hell
,
Artanis
.
Artanis
,
wait
!
I
am
not
your
enemy
...
I
have
come
seeking
the
xel'naga
--
Something
's
not
right
here
.
They
're
dead
,
Artanis
.
She
ai
n't
gon
na
stand
us
up
,
Selendis

If
she
says
it
's
important
,
you
'd
better
believe
it
is
.
Such
little
faith
for
a
Templar
.
[
looks
over
at
the
others

Artanis

Jim

So
what
's
goin
'
on
,
Sarah
?
What
's
so
urgent
,
you
got
us
all
here
for
?
Amon
lives
.
His
hatred
festers
in
the
Void
...
and
he
already
plans
to
return
.
Even
now
,
I
hear
a
voice
calling
me
...
This
voice
is
not
his
.
There
's
something
else
in
there
.
Something
tormented
and
desperate
...
but
it
's
benevolent
.
Amon
's
strength
grows
by
the
moment
.
He
may
not
return
during
our
lives
,
but
he
will
return
.
There
is
a
gateway
to
the
Void
within
Ulnar
.
I
intend
to
go
through
it
and
destroy
the
Fallen
One
once
and
for
all
.
Sarah
's
right
.
We
ca
n't
kick
this
can
down
the
road
;
this
burden
is
ours
,
like
it
or
not
.
Do
as
he
says
.
Whose
grasp
?
Narud
.
I
thought
you
were
dead
.
Hello
,
Duran
.
Do
you
remember
what
you
did
to
me
?
No
.
I
've
come
to
say
good
night
,
you
son
of
a
bitch
.
You
are
xel'naga
...
the
one
who
called
to
me
!
Who
are
you
?
Why
have
you
summoned
us
here
?
Xel'naga
?
You
want
to
change
her
...
into
one
of
you
?
No
,
dammit
...
Sarah
,
no
!
Sarah
...
you
do
n't
have
to
do
this
.
You
do
n't
have
to
let
yourself
be
mutilated
again
.
Together
we
'll
--
No
,
Jim
.
With
all
I
've
done
,
the
lives
ruined
...
worlds
destroyed
...
there
's
blood
on
my
hands
.
I
need
to
cleanse
it
.
This
...
is
my
destiny
.
These
moments
together
...
they
will
always
be
with
me
.
Darlin
'
...
I
...
We
have
to
go
now
,
Jim
.
End
this
thing
...
once
and
for
all
.
Go
,
Jim
...
go
.
Today
marks
the
third
anniversary
of
the
fall
of
the
Arcturus
Mengsk
regime
.
To
memorialize
this
milestone
,
Emperor
Valerian
Mengsk
held
a
monumental
celebration
in
the
capital
wing
of
Augustgrad
,
heralding
a
new
age
of
peace
and
prosperity
within
the
Terran
Dominion
.
On
the
Senate
steps
,
Admiral
Matthew
Horner
reaffirmed
the
military
's
support
of
the
new
Dominion
government
and
expressed
his
optimism
at
the
latest
rounds
of
peace
negotiations
with
the
unified
protoss
...
Hearts
and
minds
,
man
...
just
like
you
always
said
.
You
know
,
Matt
,
someday
you
're
gon
na
wind
up
leading
this
bunch
of
misfits
.
I
made
a
deal
with
the
devil
,
Jimmy
...
You
about
ready
to
get
out
of
here
,
cowboy
?
Hell
...
it
's
about
time
.
I
know
.
I
got
them
all
.
And
as
I
killed
each
and
every
one
of
them
,
I
knew
what
they
were
thinking
,
Fear
.
Panic
.
Hatred
.
Hopelessness
.
Breakfast
.
One
of
the
techs
had
skipped
breakfast
,
and
he
was
really
regretting
not
having
had
waffles
.
He
was
about
to
have
his
throat
slit
,
and
he
was
worried
about
waffles
.
It
sucks
being
a
telepath
.
Very
good
.
I
have
a
high
degree
of
confidence
in
the
lieutenant
.
You
have
your
tense
wrong
.
I
gave
the
orders
for
the
operation
before
we
sat
down
for
our
first
game
.
The
good
lieutenant
should
be
picking
up
the
emitter
in
the
shops
right
about
now
.
If
you
hurry
,
you
can
catch
up
with
her
.
Zeratul
.
What
do
you
want
?
My
need
to
see
Mengsk
dead
called
me
here
.
These
zerg
will
help
me
destroy
Korhal
.
I
do
n't
have
to
do
a
damn
thing
.
I
will
not
be
a
pawn
in
your
prophecies
.
Anything
.
I
'm
looking
through
the
eyes
of
my
overlords
.
These
primal
zerg
are
fascinating
.
They
show
no
signs
of
age
.
But
the
primals
feed
off
the
essence
of
individuals
.
They
're
in
the
state
of
constant
evolution
.
They
do
n't
die
.
True
.
The
most
successful
hunters
among
them
must
be
incredibly
ancient
.
And
incredibly
dangerous
.
Why
are
you
helping
me
,
Zeratul
?
You
have
more
cause
to
hate
me
than
most
.
You
know
I
do
n't
believe
in
your
mad
prophecies
.
Spare
me
your
self
pity
,
Zeratul
.
Everyone
has
to
make
peace
with
their
own
choices
.
We
all
have
to
pay
for
our
actions
someday
.
I
guess
your
day
is
almost
here
.
The
zerg
first
evolved
here
,
yes
.
Do
n't
be
so
sure
.
Zerus
may
prove
more
dangerous
than
any
world
we
've
known
.
What
do
you
think
of
the
primal
zerg
?
I
thought
you
'd
like
them
.
As
individuals
they
constantly
evolve
to
be
more
efficient
killers
.
I
sense
something
.
An
ancient
consciousness
...
sleeping
.
You
want
me
to
awaken
it
,
do
n't
you
?
What
my
enemies
fear
most
.
Always
.
So
this
is
the
Ancient
One
.
There
's
a
lot
of
biomass
here
.
We
'll
kill
these
quillgors
and
have
drones
harvest
meat
from
their
corpses
.
Once
the
drone
is
done
harvesting
,
it
will
drag
the
biomass
to
the
ancient
.
Let
them
try
.
This
pack
of
quillgor
is
our
first
target
.
Let
's
move
out
.
We
need
to
harvest
this
biomass
quickly
!
Then
find
more
quillgor
,
Izsha
.
I
'm
sensing
something
primal
nearby
,
but
it
's
small
...
I
feel
stronger
.
This
must
be
the
power
Zeratul
spoke
of
.
This
essence
is
so
...
alive
.
I
think
I
like
it
.
We
have
to
stop
them
.
Our
forces
can
intercept
their
raiding
parties
.
Nothing
stands
in
the
way
of
the
Swarm
!
We
are
almost
done
here
.
Defend
the
hive
cluster
!
Ancient
One
!
I
am
here
for
the
power
of
Zerus
.
I
will
sacrifice
anything
to
achieve
my
goal
.
You
will
help
me
.
The
Ancient
One
is
key
to
unlocking
the
power
of
Zerus
,
and
I
need
that
knowledge
.
It
's
called
a
gamble.It
's
something
terrans
do
,
when
their
instincts
tell
them
the
time
is
right
.
Yes
,
just
like
that
.
The
thing
about
gambles
,
Izsha
,
is
that
sometimes
you
lose
.
The
primal
zerg
say
the
Swarm
is
corrupted
.
What
did
the
fallen
xel'naga
,
Amon
,
do
to
us
?
The
hive
mind
.
That
's
Amon
's
corruption
?
What
are
you
talking
about
?
Abathur
,
are
you
upset
?
Do
n't
worry
about
it
.
They
'll
be
on
our
side
before
I
am
done
here
.
Power
to
kill
Mengsk
.
Tell
me
what
I
must
do
.
Everything
.
Abathur
,
send
me
the
creature
you
've
been
working
on
...
the
swarm
host
.
Here
they
come
.
It
's
...
a
pool
.
The
queen
's
hate
is
strong
enough
.
And
if
I
survive
,
it
will
remake
me
.
I
will
become
more
powerful
than
the
old
Queen
of
Blades
.
Izsha
,
defend
the
hive
cluster
and
the
chrysalis
until
I
am
done
...
or
dead
.
Zagara
,
defend
the
hive
cluster
and
the
chrysalis
until
I
am
done
...
or
dead
.
Izsha
.
What
is
a
primal
zerg
doing
on
my
leviathan
?
But
you
do
n't
fear
me
,
do
you
,
Dehaka
?
Well
,
I
've
forged
alliances
on
shakier
ground
than
that
.
Very
well
,
you
can
stay
.
Betray
me
and
I
'll
collect
your
essence
.
Do
the
remaining
pack
leaders
will
join
me
now
?
And
you
?
Well
the
pack
leaders
have
no
chance
against
the
Swarm
now
.
I
look
like
the
leader
of
the
Swarm
now
.
Perhaps
this
will
help
bring
more
broodmothers
back
into
the
fold
.
Perhaps
not
to
you
.
The
terrans
will
not
be
so
...
understanding
.
I
feel
as
I
can
rip
worlds
apart
.
He
never
controlled
me
.
I
felt
...
an
influence
.
A
trace
of
something
dark
,
but
long
gone
.
Amon
must
have
died
before
I
was
infested
.
Everything
is
different
.
I
could
always
hear
the
Swarm
,
control
it
.
But
now
...
I
feel
the
Swarm
.
Now
I
am
the
Swarm
.
Yes
,
I
am
different
.
I
am
my
own
master
.
When
the
xel'naga
artifact
made
me
human
again
,
It
cleansed
me
of
Amon
's
influence
.
And
that
allowed
me
to
become
...
something
greater
.
Do
n't
ever
try
,
Abathur
.
What
I
am
now
,
is
beyond
your
comprehension
.
Zagara
,
defend
the
leviathan
.
I
will
deal
with
the
pack
leaders
myself
.
Is
that
fear
,
Yagdra
?
You
do
know
you
never
hand
a
chance
,
right
?
It
's
laying
eggs
!
Destroy
them
!
Quickly
,
destroy
the
eggs
before
they
hatch
!
Focus
on
the
largest
ones
first
.
Zurvan
.
I
wondered
when
you
would
make
your
move
.
Of
course
.
Zerus
is
mine
.
Izsha
,
prepare
the
leviathan
.
It
's
time
to
the
Swarm
returned
to
the
Koprulu
sector
.
Kilysa
,
hear
me
.
The
planet
Mistaff
IV
is
a
hub
of
Dominion
military
production
.
Take
your
brood
there
and
destroy
it
.
Do
that
,
and
you
will
earn
your
place
within
the
Swarm
.
Did
you
know
the
Ancient
One
would
turn
on
me
?
And
you
did
n't
try
to
warn
me
.
I
think
I
am
starting
to
understand
you
,
Dehaka
.
It
's
a
two-way
communicator
.
The
Queen
of
Blades
.
I
knew
you
'd
return
to
your
true
form
.
A
monster
.
Now
,
you
'll
do
exactly
as
I
tell
you
if
you
care
at
all
about
Jim
Raynor
.
Yes
...
He
's
alive
.
So
you
'll
keep
your
Swarm
away
from
Korhal
,
and
away
from
me
,
or
he
dies
.
That
man
sacrificed
everything
to
give
you
back
your
humanity
.
And
you
threw
it
away
.
How
he
must
be
disgusted
by
you
.
Why
,
he
'd
be
first
in
line
to
kill
you
.
I
ca
n't
sense
Jim
out
there
...
If
he
is
alive
,
nothing
in
this
universe
will
stop
me
from
finding
him
.
[

]
They
'll
kill
you
.
Kill
them
all
...
I
must
have
more
!
(
after
killing
50
%
of
the
primal
zerg
)
These
waters
...
can
heal
the
wounded
.
