good day magistrate
my name is arcturus mengsk and i represent the sons of korhal
youre familiar with the confederate propaganda surrounding my group but your reputation suggests youll see past it
its never been our practice to operate in any one place for long but these zerg dont look like theyre going to wait
im going to make you an offer magistrate
id like to help you out by sending down a number of transports to your colony and evacuating any survivors
you know of course that my organization operates outside the bounds of confederate law
thats why they spread their lies and misinformation
if you decide to accept our help youll be branded as an outlaw too
but its a chance to save those people
time to make a stand magistrate
im having doubts about this arcturus
i just dont think anyone deserves to have the zerg unleashed on them
i know you have personal feelings about this
but you cant let your past cloud your judgement
carry out your orders lieutenant
yes sir
psi emitter in place
just promise me well never do anything like this again
we will do whatever it takes to save humanity
our responsibility is too great to do anything less
why are you doing this kerrigan
look i know about your past i mean ive heard the rumors
i know you were part of those experiments with the zerg that mengsk came and saved you
but you dont owe him this
hell
ive saved your butt plenty of times
jimmy drop the knight in shining armor routine
it suits you sometimes just not now
i dont need to be rescued
i know what im doing
the protoss are coming to destroy the entire planet not just the zerg
i know that because well i just know it
i am a ghost remember
once we dealt with the protoss we can do something about the zerg
arcturusll come around
i know he will
i hope youre right darling
good huntin
gentlemen youve done very well but remember that weve still got a job to do
the seeds of a new empire have been sown and if we hope to reap—
ah to hell with you
youre making a terrible mistake
dont even think to cross me
ive sacrificed too much to let this fall apart
you mean like you sacrificed kerrigan
youll regret that
you dont seem to realize my situation here
i will not be stopped
not by you or the confederates or the protoss or anyone
i will rule this sector or see it burnt to ashes around me
if you try to get in my way—
the fleet is prepped and ready commander
awaiting orders
the hell with him
were gone
fellow terrans i come to you in the wake of recent events to issue a call to reason
let no human deny the perils of our time
while we battle one another divided by the petty strife of our common history the tide of a greater conflict is turning against us threatening to destroy all that we have accomplished
it is time for us as nations and as individuals to set aside our longstanding feuds and unite
the tides of an unwinnable war are upon us and we must seek refuge upon higher ground lest we be swept away by the flood
by your will father i live to serve
let all those who oppose the overmind feel the wrath of the swarm
mother of god kerrigan what have they done to you
sarah is that really you
to an extent
im far more than i once was jim
you shouldnt have come here
but the dreams
i dreamed you were still alive that somehow you were calling to me
i was
while i was in the chrysalis i instinctively reached out to you and arcturus telepathically
apparently arcturus sent duke here to reclaim me
but that was then jim
i am one of the zerg now and i like what i am
you cant imagine how this feels
so
what
are you goin to kill me now darlin
it is certainly within my power but youre not a threat to me jim
be smart leave here now and never seek to confront the zerg again
doesnt look like i have much choice
wow
does that mean theyre gonna send some backup for us
so gerard
i suspect you have a good reason for pulling me away from myduties
your vodka can wait my good alexei
come stand here
you need to see this
i know all about the zerg gerard
weve all seen the tapes a hundred
are you prepared to go all the way with this alexei
yes yes i am prepared to go all the way my good admiral
good good i knew i could count on you
take us into orbit mr malmsteen
weve seen enough
well now i dont know which militia you all are from but i advise you all to back down now
im general edmund duke of the dominion armada
and in the name of emperor mengsk i order you to surrender your forces immediately and unconditionally
ah general duke
i had expected your forces to arrive sooner
you must know that we do not represent one of your ragtag peasant militias but the combined might of the united earth directorate
earth directorate
er you mean to tell me that you came all the way out here from earth
that is correct general
we have been sent here to take control of this sector for the betterment of mankind
over my dead body
i dont care where youre from son no one pushes around the terran dominion on my watch
all units fire at will
duran
you son of a bitch whats the meaning of this
admiral dugalle ive heard a lot about you
who the what the hell are you
i am kerrigan
the zerg you have killed here and the overmind which youve come to collect are mine
as is our mutual friend lieutenant duran
you see admiral there are several groups in this sector who feel your presence here causes certain complications
i am here to make sure your reign is shortlived
you may find that difficult you abomination seeing as how i have the means to disrupt your control of the zerg
ah yes youre referring to your vaunted psi disruptor
it wont last you forever
sooner or later ill destroy it
then ill show you what the zerg are really capable of
oh and by the way admiral your friend stukov was twice the man you are
im glad you saved me the trouble of killing him
do your worst then girl
you aint takin edmund duke without a fight
kerrigan you murdering bitch
we had a deal
oh come on arcturus
did you really think that i would allow you to come into power again
you practically fed me to the zerg on tarsonis youre directly responsible for the hell ive been through
did you honestly think that i would let you get away with that
but you said revenge was secondary to defeating the ued
i lied
i liberated this planet because it was the ueds primary staging point not because i was under any obligation to you
i used you to destroy the psi disrupter and now that ive got my broods back youre no longer necessary for my plans
i think ill leave you here arcturus among the ashes of your precious dominion
i want you to live to see me rise to power and i want you to always remember in your most private moments that it was you who let me loose in the first place
youre right fenix
i used you to get the job done and you played along just like i knew you would
you protoss are all so headstrong and predictable
you are your own worst enemies
i took that lesson to heart praetor
now are you prepared to die a second time
then that shall be your epitaph
fenix
no
he died because you betrayed him
how many more noble souls do you need to consume before youre satisfied
how many more innocent people have to die before you realize what youve become
you dont even know what youre talking about jim
dont i
ill see you dead for this kerrigan
for fenix and all the others who got caught between you and your mad quest for power
tough talk jimmy but i dont think you have what it takes to be a killer
it is done cerebrate
theyve all been destroyed
let us return to tarsonis to rest
for the first time since my transfiguration i am wearied of the slaughter
i can hardly believe this
youve killed your own matriarch
i said you are free to go
ive already taken your honor
ill let you live because i know that from now on your every waking moment will be torture
youll never be able to forgive yourself for what ive forced you to do
and that zeratul is a better revenge than i could have ever dreamed of
once again i stand atop the broken bodies of my enemies victorious but not unscarred
the earthborne directorate has been destroyed and the overmind lies dead and trampled beneath the ashes of char
as for my unlikely allies i think that i shall allow them a reprieve for in time i will seek to test their resolve and their strengths
they will all be mine in the end for i am the queen of blades
none shall ever dispute my rule again
they say a man never really knows himself until his freedoms been taken away
i wonder how well do you know yourself
prisoner step forward onto the platform
convict 
murderer
pirate
traitor
today you go free
but as youll soon learn even freedom has a price
combat suit sealed and locked
youll carry your prison with you
that armor will be your new cell
make no mistake
war is coming
with all its glory and all its horror
mr findlay your freedom awaits
hell its about time
jim raynor represents a clear and present threat to this dominion
he is an unscrupulous lawless revolutionary bent on spreading fear and dissension across the sector
he and his ragtag band of miscreants have instigated open rebellion across the sector gets blurred as jim focuses his attention on a photo of sarah kerrigani assure you this criminal will be brought to justice very soon
your forces are prepared and awaiting your orders commander
uploading tactical data now
good
bout time we kicked this revolution into overdrive
you know for the most wanted man in the sector you aint that hard to find
i had to see it for myself
little jimmy raynor the peoples hero
tychus findlay
nice suit
pays to be prepared
i heard they put you on ice
life sentence
what they give you time off for good behavior
thats right old buddy
im a model citizen now
so to what do i owe the pleasure
just a friendly business proposition
do you even know what the dominion are doing out here
im guessing youre about to tell me
digging up alien artifacts old buddy
your boy mengsk has gone crazy for them
but i got a contact that will pay top dollar for every artifact weliberate from the dominion
i guess i can hardly pass that up now can i tychus
partners then


my way
chuckles feels like old times already
old times
damn jimmy youve been holdin out on me
cuttin it pretty close there matt
never left you hanging before sir
fair enough
just get us the hell out of here
all batteries concentrate forward firepower
spin up drives two and six
all hands brace for warp jump on my mark
mark
what the hell happened
we aint seen the zerg in years
why attack mar sara now
its not just mar sara
you need to see this
the zerg swarm launched a fullscale attack 
devastation spread throughout all outer rim planets 
 sustained heavy losses 
casualties in the billions
minutes ago the zerg attacked a dominion military research facility
sweet mother of mercy
we always knew shed be back but whats she after
shes come to finish the job
ive been cleaning up after you a lot lately
leave it alone matt
same dream
i said leave it alone
what happened to kerrigan wasnt your fault
which part
where she got left behind or where she murdered eight billion people
man do you even see what youre becoming
we are who we choose to be matt
when you figure it out let us know
were waitin on ya
turn around arcturus
i want you to see this coming
you wont find my father here commander
lifts the needle from the record player silencing it i am valerian mengskand i own the moebius foundation
through them i own you as well
tell me why i shouldnt kill you right now
because i can offer you what youve always wanted
turns to face him a chance to rescue sarah kerrigan
you boys gotta wake up
raynors sold us out
i joined this outfit to fight the dominion not work for them
everybody simmer down
we trusted the commander before we should trust him now
you cant trust that drunk
jim raynors nothing but a spineless coward
youve been nothing but poison since you got on this crate
turns away
that right
grabs swann by the shirt who struggles to escape  pathetic
only person you can trust is yourself
as soon as you peons figure that out
heard about enough of this
you got them all fooled dont you jimmy
but the first sign of trouble youll just duck and run
its what you do aint it
me
them
that pretty little girlfriend of yours
dont do something youre gonna regret tychus
that aint fair
you think hes right
im just gonna run out on you
you got us working for the dominion now commander
youre taking us back to char
its like youre gone already
this aint about the dominion
our war has always been about saving lives
if the zerg wipe everyone out its all been for nothing
so im going back to char
if youre with me its your choice
just like its always been
now thats the commander ive been waiting on
satisfied
lets get back to work boys
i dont want to have to have this conversation again
looks over at his ruined jukebox and fix my damn jukebox
walks out
uh a little help here
anybody
char
if hell ever existed this is it
oceans of fire tectonic storms and an atmosphere thatll burn a man alive
but weve planned for all of that
you cant plan for the zerg general
they aint gonna fit into your nice clean time table
ive led five separate invasions against the swarm
i held the line while you and your terrorist friends hid under a rock
were all aware of your victories general
ive invited commander raynor here to assist us  with any unforeseen contingencies
well it sounds like youve got it all figured out junior
ive invested far too much in this undertaking to see it fail
speaking of which you may particularly enjoy this next step
turns on a holotransmission of arcturus mengsk
 valerian
ive just received a report that youve taken half of the fleet
care to explain yourself boy
father i am about to accomplish that which you never could
today i will defeat the queen of blades and secure peace throughout the dominion
by this act the people will finally know that i am a worthy successor to you
i love your gumption son but youre in way over your head
what makes you think you have the experience to
he aint alone arcturus
raynor
i dont know what gutter my son fished you out of but even youve got to realize that treacherous bitch cannot be saved and neither can you
well see about that
and when this is over you and me got a score to settle
shit
he deploys his rifles bayonet and impales a zergling leaping at him then has to leap aside to avoid being strafed by a trio of mutalisks
fall back
were cut off
belay that order
stand your ground
heard you boys needed some help
we came as fast as we could
aint no time to be lyin down on the job general
you magnificent son of a bitch
youre the last man i expected to see
boys i hate to interrupt but uh the natives are getting restless
thanks for the rescue but i hope it aint just the two of you
general you know ive always got a card to play
you might be a damn pirate raynor but whatever happens you saved my boys today
and i wont forget that
all in a days work general
the xelnaga artifacts been assembled
i hope to god it does what we think it does
damn straight
betting our asses on some alien piece of crap dont sit right with me
i hear you tychus but if i was banking everything on that id be quit already
cause here we are in the mouth of hell and we made it this far by leaning on each other
whether its blind luck or damn fool courage in all my years ive never seen anything like what you two jokers have pulled off
that thing may be the key to stopping the queen of blades
dominion troops turn up their radios as raynors voice is heard over their comm channels and loudspeakers  but its our sweat and blood that will make it happen
after everything that weve been through past all the fire and fury the one thing i know is that we can count on each other to get the job done
or die trying if thats what it takes
because some things are just worth fighting for
dont give up
i hear sarah
 zeratul
its been four years you show up outta nowhere and
nice to see you too
auir what was he looking for
he was trying to find out why the overmind made the queen of blades in the first place
shes the one thats going to destroy the universe
no thats just it
i think shes the only one that can save it
zerg
protoss
these are strong races
how terrible how powerful is something that plays with their fates
these shocking revelations
 veritable firestorm of antimengsk sentiment
the emperor held a news conference earlier today
emperor how do you respond to these allegations of genocide
of using aliens to
i assure you these slanderous attacks against the throne are baseless and irresponsible
sir do you still stand by the sentiment that selfless devotion to the people is the basis of your rule
well of course
i was called upon to serve the greater interest of humanity
personal power was never my goal
than how would you characterize this statement
i will not be stopped
not by you or the confederates or the protoss or anyone
i will rule this sector or see it burn to ashes around me
i
i wont stand for this
you jackals think you can come in here and question me
this interview is over
fifty years and no ones ever escaped from new folsom but we broke it open in an afternoon
i can hardly believe we pulled it off
you guys did good
now me and my spectresll finish the job
well kill mengsk and burn his dominion to the ground
overthrowing mengsk is just the start
this is about building a better tomorrow
brings up the prisoner manifest dont you see
we just released every scientist philosopher and freethinker that ever challenged mengsks rule
that was our real victory today
you really that naive
tomorrow therell be a new mengsk and another one after that
your great shining dream of the future is just an illusion
so if its all so bleak why are you here tosh
what do you get out of all this
same thing as you brother
i dont quit til mengsk is dead
vengeance doesnt factor into this
our revolutions about freedom
but it aint for the likes of us
sarah
you readin all this
you have your orders mr findlay
carry them out
tychus what have you done
i made a deal with the devil jimmy
she dies
i go free
we all got our choices to make
unsnaps the catch of his pistol holster
damn shame
jim
its okay
i gotcha
i am the swarm
armies will be shattered
worlds will burn
now at last on this world vengeance shall be mine
for i am the queen of blades
jim
jim wheres jim
we couldnt get him out
valerian lashes out with her psi powers strangling valerian you left him behind
stand down
let him go kerrigan
valerian is helping us
there is no us
iff negative
multiple hostiles inside the perimeter
scramble tac response squads three through nine
defensive manuever deltafour
prep all stations for jump
no one is going anywhere until i see jim
dominion fleet this is hyperion
cease fire
crown prince valerian is aboard
my father will sacrifice any piece on the chessboard to take the queen
we have to jump now
well lead them away and circle back for jim
kerrigan storms away towards the door sarah we need to work together
do what you want
im going to find jim
jim
are you on this frequency
jim are you out there
i´m at the rendezvous it´s all clear here
ive been thinking about what you said
there´s something dark in me jim
i need you
i need you to hear me right now
proud dominion citizens at long last our nightmare is over
the lawless terrorist jim raynor is dead
with his death comes a new era of peace
the protoss have retreated from our dominion and the zerg threat has been removed
their swarm is shattered and leaderless
soon we will eradicate every last zerg on char
in short we have won
our peace and security is assured
good night my faithful subjects
confirmed
its bloody
is it that simple
yes
and if i let you live youll call down your golden armada and they will kill me
i justify nothing
there is no moral high ground here
your people have killed billions of zerg
were all covered in blood
there may be more on my hands than yours but in the end we are both killers
lieutenant get the wounded to those shuttles
were almost there
should i send a team to get you
im fine lieutenant
just see to those wounded
ill get out another way
general
theres too many zerg
were not gonna make it
kerrigan
you listen to me
i have three shuttles packed with men to injured to ever be a threat to you
husbands fathers
you let those shuttles go
you hear me
general were surrounded
theres no way out
you bitch
youre not even human anymore
you betrayed us all
for what
petty revenge
how many innocents have you killed
how many more have to die
what if raynor could see you right now
general were surrounded
were not gonna make it
general the zerg pulled back
its a miracle
were going to make it
general
general
zeratul
what do you want
face me narud
its over
your god is dead and hes never coming back
no
sarah
no youre not him
youre not jim
youre nothing
sarah
realizes that kerrigan has reverted to zerg form no
i had to get you out
what have you done
what i had to
tell that to fenix
tell it to the millions you butchered
you swore youd kill the queen of blades
you were the only one who ever believed in me
do you still believe in me
i love you jim
never forget it
were done
jim is doing well
hes in the medbay
but i dont think he wants to talk to anyb
im here to talk to you valerian
you understand that im going to korhal soon
i do
you plan to kill my father
hes had this coming for a long time
i need to know where you stand
i stand for my people
ive accepted that my father is beyond redemption and must be removed from power
im glad we understand each other
im going to korhal
its time
why are you telling us this kerrigan
there will be ruin destruction millions could die amid the chaos
valerian your people will need a leader
youre right kerrigan they will
if i am to be that leader ill ask only one thing of you
bring your swarm down outside the city
that will give us time to evacuate
korhal is going to be the most difficult battle of my life and youre asking me to make it harder
i am
i was wrong about you valerian
youre not like your father
ill give you your chance
make the most of it
hello kerrigan
ive been waiting for you
im surprised you havent tried to escape
escape
chuckles my dear im afraid youve got it all wrong
really
did you think id keep an animal like you close to me without some kind of insurance policy
gives kerrigan another jolt clearly you are my greatest failure
now at long last you will die
change of plans
you can never suffer enough for all the lives youve ruined arcturus
i made you into a monster kerrigan
you made us all into monsters
thank you jim for everything
my pleasure darlin
smiles always was
fate aint written artanis
way i see it if zeratul believed you could make a difference in all this then this fights just begun
give em hell artanis
artanis wait
i am not your enemy
i have come seeking the xelnaga 
somethings not right here
theyre dead artanis
she aint gonna stand us up selendis
if she says its important youd better believe it is
such little faith for a templar
looks over at the others artanis jim
so whats goin on sarah
whats so urgent you got us all here for
amon lives
his hatred festers in the void and he already plans to return
even now i hear a voice calling me
this voice is not his
theres something else in there
something tormented and desperate but its benevolent
amons strength grows by the moment
he may not return during our lives but he will return
there is a gateway to the void within ulnar
i intend to go through it and destroy the fallen one once and for all
sarahs right
we cant kick this can down the road this burden is ours like it or not
do as he says
whose grasp
narud
i thought you were dead
hello duran
do you remember what you did to me
no
ive come to say good night you son of a bitch
you are xelnaga the one who called to me
who are you
why have you summoned us here
xelnaga
you want to change her into one of you
no dammit sarah no
sarah you dont have to do this
you dont have to let yourself be mutilated again
together well 
no jim
with all ive done the lives ruined worlds destroyed theres blood on my hands
i need to cleanse it
this is my destiny
these moments together they will always be with me
darlin
i
we have to go now jim
end this thing once and for all
go jim go
today marks the third anniversary of the fall of the arcturus mengsk regime
to memorialize this milestone emperor valerian mengsk held a monumental celebration in the capital wing of augustgrad heralding a new age of peace and prosperity within the terran dominion
on the senate steps admiral matthew horner reaffirmed the militarys support of the new dominion government and expressed his optimism at the latest rounds of peace negotiations with the unified protoss
hearts and minds man just like you always said
you know matt someday youre gonna wind up leading this bunch of misfits
i made a deal with the devil jimmy
you about ready to get out of here cowboy
hell its about time
i know
i got them all
and as i killed each and every one of them i knew what they were thinking fear
panic
hatred
hopelessness
breakfast
one of the techs had skipped breakfast and he was really regretting not having had waffles
he was about to have his throat slit and he was worried about waffles
it sucks being a telepath
very good
i have a high degree of confidence in the lieutenant
you have your tense wrong
i gave the orders for the operation before we sat down for our first game
the good lieutenant should be picking up the emitter in the shops right about now
if you hurry you can catch up with her
zeratul
what do you want
my need to see mengsk dead called me here
these zerg will help me destroy korhal
i dont have to do a damn thing
i will not be a pawn in your prophecies
anything
im looking through the eyes of my overlords
these primal zerg are fascinating
they show no signs of age
but the primals feed off the essence of individuals
theyre in the state of constant evolution
they dont die
true
the most successful hunters among them must be incredibly ancient
and incredibly dangerous
why are you helping me zeratul
you have more cause to hate me than most
you know i dont believe in your mad prophecies
spare me your self pity zeratul
everyone has to make peace with their own choices
we all have to pay for our actions someday
i guess your day is almost here
the zerg first evolved here yes
dont be so sure
zerus may prove more dangerous than any world weve known
what do you think of the primal zerg
i thought youd like them
as individuals they constantly evolve to be more efficient killers
i sense something
an ancient consciousness sleeping
you want me to awaken it dont you
what my enemies fear most
always
so this is the ancient one
theres a lot of biomass here
well kill these quillgors and have drones harvest meat from their corpses
once the drone is done harvesting it will drag the biomass to the ancient
let them try
this pack of quillgor is our first target
lets move out
we need to harvest this biomass quickly
then find more quillgor izsha
im sensing something primal nearby but its small
i feel stronger
this must be the power zeratul spoke of
this essence is so alive
i think i like it
we have to stop them
our forces can intercept their raiding parties
nothing stands in the way of the swarm
we are almost done here
defend the hive cluster
ancient one
i am here for the power of zerus
i will sacrifice anything to achieve my goal
you will help me
the ancient one is key to unlocking the power of zerus and i need that knowledge
its called a gambleits something terrans do when their instincts tell them the time is right
yes just like that
the thing about gambles izsha is that sometimes you lose
the primal zerg say the swarm is corrupted
what did the fallen xelnaga amon do to us
the hive mind
thats amons corruption
what are you talking about
abathur are you upset
dont worry about it
theyll be on our side before i am done here
power to kill mengsk
tell me what i must do
everything
abathur send me the creature youve been working on the swarm host
here they come
its a pool
the queens hate is strong enough
and if i survive it will remake me
i will become more powerful than the old queen of blades
izsha defend the hive cluster and the chrysalis until i am done or dead
zagara defend the hive cluster and the chrysalis until i am done or dead
izsha
what is a primal zerg doing on my leviathan
but you dont fear me do you dehaka
well ive forged alliances on shakier ground than that
very well you can stay
betray me and ill collect your essence
do the remaining pack leaders will join me now
and you
well the pack leaders have no chance against the swarm now
i look like the leader of the swarm now
perhaps this will help bring more broodmothers back into the fold
perhaps not to you
the terrans will not be so understanding
i feel as i can rip worlds apart
he never controlled me
i felt an influence
a trace of something dark but long gone
amon must have died before i was infested
everything is different
i could always hear the swarm control it
but now
i feel the swarm
now i am the swarm
yes i am different
i am my own master
when the xelnaga artifact made me human again it cleansed me of amons influence
and that allowed me to become something greater
dont ever try abathur
what i am now is beyond your comprehension
zagara defend the leviathan
i will deal with the pack leaders myself
is that fear yagdra
you do know you never hand a chance right
its laying eggs
destroy them
quickly destroy the eggs before they hatch
focus on the largest ones first
zurvan
i wondered when you would make your move
of course
zerus is mine
izsha prepare the leviathan
its time to the swarm returned to the koprulu sector
kilysa hear me
the planet mistaff iv is a hub of dominion military production
take your brood there and destroy it
do that and you will earn your place within the swarm
did you know the ancient one would turn on me
and you didnt try to warn me
i think i am starting to understand you dehaka
its a twoway communicator
the queen of blades
i knew youd return to your true form
a monster
now youll do exactly as i tell you if you care at all about jim raynor
yes
hes alive
so youll keep your swarm away from korhal and away from me or he dies
that man sacrificed everything to give you back your humanity
and you threw it away
how he must be disgusted by you
why hed be first in line to kill you
i cant sense jim out there
if he is alive nothing in this universe will stop me from finding him
theyll kill you
kill them alli must have more
after killing  of the primal zerg
these waterscan heal the wounded
what heart
