good
day
magistrate
my
name
is
arcturus
mengsk
and
i
represent
the
sons
of
korhal
you
re
familiar
with
the
confederate
propaganda
surrounding
my
group
but
your
reputation
suggests
you
ll
see
past
it
it
s
never
been
our
practice
to
operate
in
any
one
place
for
long
but
these
zerg
do
nt
look
like
they
re
going
to
wait
i
m
going
to
make
you
an
offer
magistrate
i
d
like
to
help
you
out
by
sending
down
a
number
of
transports
to
your
colony
and
evacuating
any
survivors
you
know
of
course
that
my
organization
operates
outside
the
bounds
of
confederate
law
that
s
why
they
spread
their
lies
and
misinformation
if
you
decide
to
accept
our
help
you
ll
be
branded
as
an
outlaw
too
but
it
s
a
chance
to
save
those
people
time
to
make
a
stand
magistrate
i
m
having
doubts
about
this
arcturus
i
just
do
nt
think
anyone
deserves
to
have
the
zerg
unleashed
on
them
i
know
you
have
personal
feelings
about
this
but
you
ca
nt
let
your
past
cloud
your
judgement
carry
out
your
orders
lieutenant
yes
sir
psi
emitter
in
place
just
promise
me
we
ll
never
do
anything
like
this
again
we
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
save
humanity
our
responsibility
is
too
great
to
do
anything
less
why
are
you
doing
this
kerrigan
look
i
know
about
your
past
i
mean
i
ve
heard
the
rumors
i
know
you
were
part
of
those
experiments
with
the
zerg
that
mengsk
came
and
saved
you
but
you
do
nt
owe
him
this
hell
i
ve
saved
your
butt
plenty
of
times
jimmy
drop
the
knight
in
shining
armor
routine
it
suits
you
sometimes
just
not
now
i
do
nt
need
to
be
rescued
i
know
what
i
m
doing
the
protoss
are
coming
to
destroy
the
entire
planet
not
just
the
zerg
i
know
that
because
well
i
just
know
it
i
am
a
ghost
remember
once
we
dealt
with
the
protoss
we
can
do
something
about
the
zerg
arcturus
ll
come
around
i
know
he
will
i
hope
you
re
right
darling
good
huntin
gentlemen
you
ve
done
very
well
but
remember
that
we
ve
still
got
a
job
to
do
the
seeds
of
a
new
empire
have
been
sown
and
if
we
hope
to
reap—
ah
to
hell
with
you
you
re
making
a
terrible
mistake
do
nt
even
think
to
cross
me
i
ve
sacrificed
too
much
to
let
this
fall
apart
you
mean
like
you
sacrificed
kerrigan
you
ll
regret
that
you
do
nt
seem
to
realize
my
situation
here
i
will
not
be
stopped
not
by
you
or
the
confederates
or
the
protoss
or
anyone
i
will
rule
this
sector
or
see
it
burnt
to
ashes
around
me
if
you
try
to
get
in
my
way—
the
fleet
is
prepped
and
ready
commander
awaiting
orders
the
hell
with
him
we
re
gone
fellow
terrans
i
come
to
you
in
the
wake
of
recent
events
to
issue
a
call
to
reason
let
no
human
deny
the
perils
of
our
time
while
we
battle
one
another
divided
by
the
petty
strife
of
our
common
history
the
tide
of
a
greater
conflict
is
turning
against
us
threatening
to
destroy
all
that
we
have
accomplished
it
is
time
for
us
as
nations
and
as
individuals
to
set
aside
our
longstanding
feuds
and
unite
the
tides
of
an
unwinnable
war
are
upon
us
and
we
must
seek
refuge
upon
higher
ground
lest
we
be
swept
away
by
the
flood
by
your
will
father
i
live
to
serve
let
all
those
who
oppose
the
overmind
feel
the
wrath
of
the
swarm
mother
of
god
kerrigan
what
have
they
done
to
you
sarah
is
that
really
you
to
an
extent
i
m
far
more
than
i
once
was
jim
you
should
nt
have
come
here
but
the
dreams
i
dreamed
you
were
still
alive
that
somehow
you
were
calling
to
me
i
was
while
i
was
in
the
chrysalis
i
instinctively
reached
out
to
you
and
arcturus
telepathically
apparently
arcturus
sent
duke
here
to
reclaim
me
but
that
was
then
jim
i
am
one
of
the
zerg
now
and
i
like
what
i
am
you
ca
nt
imagine
how
this
feels
so
what
are
you
goin
to
kill
me
now
darlin
it
is
certainly
within
my
power
but
you
re
not
a
threat
to
me
jim
be
smart
leave
here
now
and
never
seek
to
confront
the
zerg
again
does
nt
look
like
i
have
much
choice
wow
does
that
mean
they
re
gon
na
send
some
backup
for
us
so
gerard
i
suspect
you
have
a
good
reason
for
pulling
me
away
from
my
duties
your
vodka
can
wait
my
good
alexei
come
stand
here
you
need
to
see
this

all
about
the
zerg

tapes

hundred
are
you
prepared
to
go
all
the
way
with
this
alexei
yes
yes

am
prepared
to
go
all
the
way
my
good
admiral

could
count
on
you
take
us
into
orbit
mr
malmsteen

well
now
i
do
nt
know
which
militia

in
the
name
of
emperor
mengsk

surrender
your
forces

and
unconditionally
ah
general
duke
i
had
expected
your
forces
to
arrive
sooner
you
must
know
that
we
do
not
represent
one
of
your
ragtag
peasant
militias
but
the
combined
might
of
the
united
earth
directorate
earth
directorate
er
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
came
all
the
way
out
here
from
earth
that
is
correct
general
we
have
been
sent
here
to
take
control
of
this
sector
for
the
betterment
of
mankind
over
my
dead
body
i
do
nt
care
where
you
re
from
son
no
one
pushes
around
the
terran
dominion
on
my
watch
all
units
fire
at
will
duran
you
son
of
a
bitch
what
s
the
meaning
of
this
admiral
dugalle
i
ve
heard
a
lot
about
you
who
the
what
the
hell
are
you
i
am
kerrigan
the
zerg
you
have
killed
here
and
the
overmind
which
you
ve
come
to
collect
are
mine
as
is
our
mutual
friend
lieutenant
duran
you
see
admiral
there
are
several
groups
in
this
sector
who
feel
your
presence
here
causes
certain
complications
i
am
here
to
make
sure
your
reign
is
shortlived
you
may
find
that
difficult
you
abomination
seeing
as
how
i
have
the
means
to
disrupt
your
control
of
the
zerg
ah
yes
you
re
referring
to
your
vaunted
psi
disruptor
it
wo
nt
last
you
forever
sooner
or
later
i
ll
destroy
it
then
i
ll
show
you
what
the
zerg
are
really
capable
of
oh
and
by
the
way
admiral
your
friend
stukov
was
twice
the
man
you
are
i
m
glad
you
saved
me
the
trouble
of
killing
him
do
your
worst
then
girl
you
ai
nt
takin
edmund
duke
without
a
fight
kerrigan
you
murdering
bitch
we
had
a
deal
oh
come
on
arcturus
did
you
really
think
that
i
would
allow
you
to
come
into
power
again
you
practically
fed
me
to
the
zerg
on
tarsonis
you
re
directly
responsible
for
the
hell
i
ve
been
through
did
you
honestly
think
that
i
would
let
you
get
away
with
that
but
you
said
revenge
was
secondary
to
defeating
the
ued
i
lied
i
liberated
this
planet
because
it
was
the
ued
s
primary
staging
point
not
because
i
was
under
any
obligation
to
you
i
used
you
to
destroy
the
psi
disrupter
and
now
that
i
ve
got
my
broods
back
you
re
no
longer
necessary
for
my
plans
i
think
i
ll
leave
you
here
arcturus
among
the
ashes
of
your
precious
dominion
i
want
you
to
live
to
see
me
rise
to
power
and
i
want
you
to
always
remember
in
your
most
private
moments
that
it
was
you
who
let
me
loose
in
the
first
place
you
re
right
fenix
i
used
you
to
get
the
job
done
and
you
played
along
just
like
i
knew
you
would
you
protoss
are
all
so
headstrong
and
predictable
you
are
your
own
worst
enemies
i
took
that
lesson
to
heart
praetor
now
are
you
prepared
to
die
a
second
time
then
that
shall
be
your
epitaph
fenix
no
he
died
because
you
betrayed
him
how
many
more
noble
souls
do
you
need
to
consume
before
you
re
satisfied
how
many
more
innocent
people
have
to
die
before
you
realize
what
you
ve
become
you
do
nt
even
know
what
you
re
talking
about
jim
do
nt
i
i
ll
see
you
dead
for
this
kerrigan
for
fenix
and
all
the
others
who
got
caught
between
you
and
your
mad
quest
for
power
tough
talk
jimmy
but
i
do
nt
think
you
have
what
it
takes
to
be
a
killer
it
is
done
cerebrate
they
ve
all
been
destroyed
let
us
return
to
tarsonis
to
rest
for
the
first
time
since
my
transfiguration
i
am
wearied
of
the
slaughter
i
can
hardly
believe
this
you
ve
killed
your
own
matriarch
i
said
you
are
free
to
go
i
ve
already
taken
your
honor
i
ll
let
you
live
because
i
know
that
from
now
on
your
every
waking
moment
will
be
torture
you
ll
never
be
able
to
forgive
yourself
for
what
i
ve
forced
you
to
do
and
that
zeratul
is
a
better
revenge
than
i
could
have
ever
dreamed
of
once
again
i
stand
atop
the
broken
bodies
of
my
enemies
victorious
but
not
unscarred
the
earthborne
directorate
has
been
destroyed
and
the
overmind
lies
dead
and
trampled
beneath
the
ashes
of
char
as
for
my
unlikely
allies
i
think
that
i
shall
allow
them
a
reprieve
for
in
time
i
will
seek
to
test
their
resolve
and
their
strengths
they
will
all
be
mine
in
the
end
for
i
am
the
queen
of
blades
none
shall
ever
dispute
my
rule
again
they
say
a
man
never
really
knows
himself
until
his
freedom
s
been
taken
away
i
wonder
how
well
do
you
know
yourself
prisoner
step
forward
onto
the
platform
convict
murderer
pirate
traitor
today
you
go
free
but
as
you
ll
soon
learn
even
freedom
has
a
price
combat
suit
sealed
and
locked
you
ll
carry
your
prison
with
you
that
armor
will
be
your
new
cell
make
no
mistake
war
is
coming
with
all
its
glory
and
all
its
horror
mr
findlay
your
freedom
awaits
hell
it
s
about
time
jim
raynor
represents
a
clear
and
present
threat
to
this
dominion
he
is
an
unscrupulous
lawless
revolutionary
bent
on
spreading
fear
and
dissension
across
the
sector
he
and
his
ragtag
band
of
miscreants
have
instigated
open
rebellion
across
the
sector

blurred
as
jim
focuses
his
attention
on
a
photo
of
sarah
kerrigan

assure
you
this
criminal
will
be
brought
to
justice
very
soon

like
you
ve
got
it
all
figured
out
junior
i
ve
invested
far
too
much
in
this
undertaking
to
see
it
fail
speaking
of
which
you
may
particularly
enjoy
this
next
step
turns
on
a
holotransmission
of
arcturus
mengsk
valerian
i
ve
just
received
a
report
that
you
ve
taken
half
of
the
fleet
care
to
explain
yourself
boy
father
i
am
about
to
accomplish
that
which
you
never
could
today
i
will
defeat
the
queen
of
blades
and
secure
peace
throughout
the
dominion
by
this
act
the
people
will
finally
know
that
i
am
a
worthy
successor
to
you
i
love
your
gumption
son
but
you
re
in
way
over
your
head
what
makes
you
think
you
have
the
experience
to
he
ai
nt
alone
arcturus
raynor
i
do
nt
know
what
gutter
my
son
fished
you
out
of
but
even
you
ve
got
to
realize
that
treacherous
bitch
can
not
be
saved
and
neither
can
you
we
ll
see
about
that
and
when
this
is
over
you
and
me
got
a
score
to
settle
shit
he
deploys
his
rifle
s
bayonet
and
impales
a
zergling
leaping
at
him
then
has
to
leap
aside
to
avoid
being
strafed
by
a
trio
of
mutalisks
fall
back
we
re
cut
off
belay
that
order
stand
your
ground
heard
you
boys
needed
some
help
we
came
as
fast
as
we
could
ai
nt
no
time
to
be
lyin
down
on
the
job
general
you
magnificent
son
of
a
bitch
you
re
the
last
man
i
expected
to
see
boys
i
hate
to
interrupt
but
uh
the
natives
are
getting
restless
thanks
for
the
rescue
but
i
hope
it
ai
nt
just
the
two
of
you
general
you
know
i
ve
always
got
a
card
to
play
you
might
be
a
damn
pirate
raynor
but
whatever
happens
you
saved
my
boys
today
and
i
wo
nt
forget
that
all
in
a
day
s
work
general
the
xelnaga
artifact
s
been
assembled
i
hope
to
god
it
does
what
we
think
it
does
damn
straight
betting
our
asses
on
some
alien
piece
of
crap
do
nt
sit
right
with
me
i
hear
you
tychus
but
if
i
was
banking
everything
on
that
i
d
be
quit
already
cause
here
we
are
in
the
mouth
of
hell
and
we
made
it
this
far
by
leaning
on
each
other
whether
it
s
blind
luck
or
damn
fool
courage
in
all
my
years
i
ve
never
seen
anything
like
what
you
two
jokers
have
pulled
off
that
thing
may
be
the
key
to
stopping
the
queen
of
blades
dominion
troops
turn
up
their
radios
as
raynor
s
voice
is
heard
over
their
comm
channels
and
loudspeakers
but
it
s
our
sweat
and
blood
that
will
make
it
happen
after
everything
that
we
ve
been
through
past
all
the
fire
and
fury
the
one
thing
i
know
is
that
we
can
count
on
each
other
to
get
the
job
done
or
die
trying
if
that
s
what
it
takes
because
some
things
are
just
worth
fighting
for
do
nt
give
up
i
hear
sarah
zeratul
it
s
been
four
years
you
show
up
outta
nowhere
and
nice
to
see
you
too
auir
what
was
he
looking
for
he
was
trying
to
find
out
why
the
overmind
made
the
queen
of
blades
in
the
first
place
she
s
the
one
that
s
going
to
destroy
the
universe

the
only
one
that
can
save
it
zerg

antimengsk
sentiment
the

news
conference
earlier

you
respond

these
allegations

genocide

i
assure

these
slanderous
attacks

throne
are
baseless
and
irresponsible

you

stand
by
the
sentiment
that
selfless
devotion
to
the

is
the
basis
of
your
rule

negotiations
with

protoss
hearts
and

man
just
like
you

matt
someday

this
bunch
of
misfits

cowboy
hell
it
s
about
time
i
know
i
got
them

as
i
killed
each
and
every
one
of

knew
what
they
were
thinking
fear
panic
hatred
hopelessness
breakfast
one
of
the
techs
had
skipped
breakfast
and
he
was
really
regretting
not
having
had
waffles
he
was
about
to
have
his
throat
slit
and
he
was
worried
about
waffles
it
sucks
being
a
telepath
very
good
i
have
a
high
degree
of
confidence
in
the
lieutenant
you
have
your
tense
wrong
i
gave
the
orders
for
the
operation
before
we
sat
down
for
our
first
game
the
good
lieutenant
should
be
picking
up
the
emitter
in
the
shops
right
about
now
if
you
hurry
you
can
catch
up
with
her
zeratul
what

help
me
destroy
korhal
i
do
nt
have
to
do
a
damn
thing
i
will
not
be
a
pawn
in
your
prophecies
anything
i
m
looking
through
the
eyes
of
my
overlords
these
primal
zerg
are
fascinating
they
show
no
signs
of
age
but
the
primals
feed
off
the
essence
of
individuals
they
re
in
the
state
of
constant
evolution
they
do
nt
die
true
the
most
successful
hunters
among
them
must
be
incredibly
ancient
and
incredibly
dangerous
why
are
you
helping
me
zeratul
you
have
more
cause
to
hate
me
than
most
you
know
i
do
nt
believe
in
your
mad
prophecies
spare
me
your
self
pity
zeratul
everyone
has
to
make
peace
with
their
own
choices
we
all
have
to
pay
for
our
actions
someday
i
guess
your
day
is
almost
here
the
zerg
first
evolved
here
yes
do
nt
be
so
sure
zerus
may
prove
more
dangerous
than
any
world
we
ve
known
what
do
you
think
of
the
primal
zerg
i
thought
you
d
like
them
as
individuals
they
constantly
evolve
to
be
more
efficient
killers
i
sense
something
an
ancient
consciousness
sleeping
you
want
me
to
awaken
it
do
nt
you
what
my
enemies
fear
most
always
so
this
is
the
ancient
one
there
s
a
lot
of
biomass
here
we
ll
kill
these
quillgors
and
have
drones
harvest
meat
from
their
corpses
once
the
drone
is
done
harvesting
it
will
drag
the
biomass
to
the
ancient
let
them
try
this
pack
of
quillgor
is
our
first
target
let
s
move
out
we
need
to
harvest
this
biomass
quickly
then
find
more
quillgor
izsha
i
m
sensing
something
primal
nearby
but
it
s
small
i
feel
stronger
this
must
be
the
power
zeratul
spoke
of
this
essence
is
so
alive
i
think
i
like
it
we
have
to
stop
them
our
forces
can
intercept
their
raiding
parties
nothing
stands
in
the
way
of
the
swarm
we
are
almost
done
here
defend
the
hive
cluster
ancient
one
i
am
here
for
the
power
of
zerus
i
will
sacrifice
anything
to
achieve
my
goal
you
will
help
me
the
ancient
one
is
key
to
unlocking
the
power
of
zerus
and
i
need
that
knowledge
it
s
called
a
gambleit
s
something
terrans
do
when
their
instincts
tell
them
the
time
is
right
yes
just
like
that
the
thing
about
gambles
izsha
is
that
sometimes
you
lose
the
primal
zerg
say
the
swarm
is
corrupted
what
did
the
fallen
xelnaga
amon
do
to
us
the
hive
mind
that
s
amon
s
corruption
what
are
you
talking
about
abathur
are
you
upset
do
nt
worry
about
it
they
ll
be
on
our
side
before
i
am
done
here

kill
mengsk
tell
me
what
i
must
do
everything
abathur
send
me
the
creature
you
ve
been
working
on
the
swarm
host
here
they
come
it
s
a
pool
the
queen
s
hate
is
strong
enough
and
if
i
survive
it
will
remake
me
i
will
become
more
powerful
than
the
old
queen
of
blades
izsha
defend
the
hive
cluster
and
the
chrysalis
until
i
am
done
or
dead
zagara

izsha
what
is
a
primal
zerg
doing
on
my
leviathan
but
you
do
nt
fear
me
do
you
dehaka
well
i
ve
forged
alliances
on
shakier
ground
than
that
very
well
you
can
stay
betray
me
and
i
ll
collect
your
essence
do
the
remaining
pack
leaders
will
join
me
now
and
you
well
the
pack
leaders
have
no
chance
against
the
swarm
now
i
look
like
the
leader
of
the
swarm
now
perhaps
this
will
help
bring
more
broodmothers
back
into
the
fold
perhaps
not
to
you
the
terrans
will
not
be
so
understanding
i
feel
as
i
can
rip
worlds
apart
he
never
controlled
me
i
felt
an
influence
a
trace
of
something
dark
but
long
gone
amon
must
have
died
before
i
was
infested
everything
is
different
i
could
always
hear
the
swarm
control
it
but
now
i
feel
the
swarm
now
i
am
the
swarm
yes
i
am
different
i
am
my
own
master
when
the
xelnaga
artifact
made
me
human
again
it
cleansed
me
of
amon
s
influence
and
that
allowed
me
to
become
something
greater
do
nt
ever
try
abathur
what
i
am
now
is
beyond
your
comprehension
zagara
defend
the
leviathan
i
will
deal
with
the
pack
leaders
myself
is
that
fear
yagdra

you
never

a
chance
right
it
s
laying
eggs

the
eggs
before

a
hub
of
dominion

your
brood
there
and
destroy
it

that
and
you
will
earn
your
place
within
the
swarm
did
you
know
the
ancient
one
would
turn
on
me
and
you
did
nt
try
to
warn
me
i
think
i

starting
to
understand
you
dehaka
it
s
a
twoway
communicator
the
queen
of
blades
i
knew
you
d
return
to
your
true
form

exactly
as
i
tell
you
if
you
care
at
all
about
jim
raynor
yes
he
s
alive
so
you
ll
keep
your
swarm
away
from
korhal
and
away
from
me
or
he
dies
that
man
sacrificed
everything
to
give
you
back
your
humanity
and
you
threw
it
away
how
he
must
be
disgusted
by
you
why
he
d
be
first
in
line
to
kill
you
i
ca
nt
sense
jim
out
there
if
he
is
alive
nothing
in
this
universe
will
stop
me
from
finding
him
they
ll
kill
you

them

i
must
have
more
after
killing
of
the
primal
zerg
these
waters

heal
the
wounded
