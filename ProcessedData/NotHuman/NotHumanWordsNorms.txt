awaken
my
child
and
embrace
the
glory
that
is
your
birthright
know
that
i
am
the
overmind
the
eternal
will
of
the
swarm
and
that
you
have
been
created
to
serve
me
arise
my
daughter
arise
kerrigan
well
done
cerebrate
what
i
have
wrought
this
day
shall
be
the
undoing
of
my
enemies
let
not
a
terran
survive
now
shall
the
events
set
into
motion
so
long
ago
be
made
complete
for
the
protoss
too
were
created
by
the
xelnaga
they
were
the
first
creation
gifted
with
a
purity
of
form
and
we
were
the
second
creation
blessed
with
a
purity
of
essence
indeed
our
two
species
are
but
opposite
facets
of
a
greater
whole
soon
shall
our
two
races
be
made
as
one
thenceforth
shall
all
feel
the
wrath
of
the
eternal
swarm
for
the
hour
of
judgement
is
come
ah
tassadar
have
you
fallen
so
far
to
think
that
you
were
our
brightest
hope
our
most
beloved
son
now
you
are
everything
that
we
are
not
you
are
lost
to
us
not
only
have
you
damned
yourself
but
you
have
damned
those
who
have
followed
you
my
friends
this
is
our
final
hour
not
all
of
us
may
survive
the
coming
conflict
yet
death
may
be
a
blessing
should
we
fail
here
we
seek
now
to
destroy
a
foe
that
has
ravaged
its
way
across
the
universe
consuming
all
in
its
path
and
now
it
has
reached
the
end
of
its
long
journey
the
overmind
has
come
to
destroy
all
that
we
hold
dear
and
assimilate
us
into
itself
and
i
say
to
thee
this
shall
not
come
to
pass
aiur
shall
not
fall
executor
i
stand
ready
as
do
i
executor
tassadar
this
comes
too
late
to
you
but
the
conclave
has
witnessed
your
defeat
of
the
cerebrate
they
know
now
that
they
can
not
deny
the
necessity
or
the
valiancy
of
your
actions
we
sought
to
punish
you
while
it
was
we
who
were
in
error
you
represent
what
is
greatest
in
us
all
and
all
our
hopes
go
with
you
en
taro
adun
brave
sons
of
aiur
you
believe
me
to
be
a
traitor
but
it
is
you
and
the
matriarch
who
will
usher
our
race
to
oblivion
it
is
finished
judicator
surrender
your
remaining
forces
and
join
us
in
eradicating
the
zerg
i
would
sooner
die
dark
one
than
tarnish
the
memory
of
aiur
by
joining
with
you
uh
excuse
me
admiral
but
i
d
like
to
introduce
someone
to
you
this
is
a
betrayal
most
foul
kerrigan
we
were
fools
to
have
gone
along
with
this
charade
that
s
ironic
i
can
remember
tassadar
teaching
you
a
very
similar
lesson
on
char
the
khala
awaits
me
kerrigan
and
though
i
am
prepared
to
face
my
destiny
you
will
not
find
me
easy
prey
better
that
i
killed
her
than
let
her
live
as
your
slave
kerrigan
what
you
will
regret
this
decision
kerrigan
we
shall
meet
again
have
you
any
conception
of
what
you
ve
created
here
do
you
have
any
idea
what
this
this
hybrid
is
capable
of
of
course
i
do
this
creature
is
the
completion
of
a
cycle
its
role
in
the
cosmic
order
was
preordained
when
the
stars
were
young
behold
the
culmination
of
your
history
all
i
behold
is
an
abomination
your
violence
young
prodigal
is
typical
as
is
your
inability
to
comprehend
the
greater
scheme
of
things
you
can
destroy
all
of
the
specimens
here
it
will
do
you
no
good
for
i
have
seeded
the
hybrid
on
many
many
worlds
you
will
never
find
them
all
before
they
awaken
and
when
they
do
your
universe
will
be
changed
forever
james
raynor
i
bring
tidings
of
doom
i
have
pierced
the
veil
of
the
future
and
beheld
only
oblivion
yet
one
spark
of
hope
remains
you
will
hold
her
life
in
your
hands
and
though
justice
demands
that
she
die
for
her
crimes
only
she
can
save
us
time
is
short
you
must
understand
the
answers
you
seek
lie
within
study
it
well
the
fate
of
creation
hangs
in
the
balance
it
begins
with
a
great
hunger
it
ends
in
utter
darkness
i
returned
to
our
ruined
homeworld
of
auir
the
zerg
infestation
still
covered
much
of
our
beloved
world
the
desiccated
remains
of
the
overmind
were
still
there
a
grim
reminder
of
battles
lost
and
battles
won
the
hunt
goes
well
my
queen
those
protoss
would
kill
you
if
they
could
they
are
not
zerg
that
means
they
are
the
enemy
for
the
zerg
it
is
whatever
my
queen
has
lost
think
what
she
has
gained
purity
of
essence
you
are
the
will
of
the
swarm
we
are
only
colonists
and
you
are
killing
us
kill
thousands
to
save
yourself
is
that
how
you
justify
this
believe
kerrigan
i
have
been
to
the
beginning
behold
zerus
birthplace
of
the
zerg
here
the
zerg
evolved
and
here
the
dark
one
altered
them
those
left
behind
are
the
primal
zerg
they
fight
they
kill
they
evolve
just
as
you
must
if
you
survive
it
is
only
beginning

how
how

artanis
up
close
he
believes
he
was
brought
from

and
made
a
dragoon
why
are
you
here
fenix
i
was
given
a
directive
by
aldaris
himself
to
come
to
glacius
and
serve
the
templar
it
is
the
last
recollection
from
his

the
great
templar
were
still
encoded
by
order
of
the
conclave
do
you
know
about
the
experimentation
done
on
glacius
why
aldaris
gave
you
this
order
i
am
a
warrior
old

you
know
this
as
well
as
any
it
is
not
in

place
to

his

is
highly
advanced
an

composed
of

to
be
the

enough

it
is

that
those
of

separated
from

none

us
are
ever
truly
alone
for

what
is
relevant
is
that
amon
has
opened
a
gateway
to
the

they
will
consume
your
precious

dryly
you
care
little
for
my

alarak
what
is
the
true
reason
you
ve
come
to
me
our

broke
his
ancient
covenant
and
cast
us
low
these
are
lies

i
come
with
an
offer
you
will
aid
me
in
invoking
a
challenge
for
the
right
to
rule
my

as
highlord
and
in
return
i
will
grant
you
a
cessation
of

between

rally
my

it
appears
we
have
much
to
discuss
as
he
consumes
an
orb
of
terrazine
gas
slaying
malash

guardians
fulfilled
more
than
one
purpose
once
the

lies
dead
at
my
feet
none
will
challenge
my
rule
clearly
altered
walking
around
artanis
like
a
vulture
after
all
these
years
my
victory
is
nearly
at
hand
i
feel
his
concern
artanis
he
knows
that
i
m
coming
for
him
malash
no
amon
through
the
breath
of
creation
i
peer
through
the
veil
delighted
oh
yes
i
feel
his
rage
washing
over
me
he
knows
i
no
longer
fear
him
he
knows
that
the
taldarim
have
no
khala
for
him
to
control
i
will
turn
the
chosen
against
him
warning
do
not
assume
you
are
already
victorious
alarak
do
not
let
the
terrazine
cloud
your
judgment
you
have
a
battle
to
win
first
the
battle
is
already
won
in
my
mind
s
eye
i
have
delivered
the
killing
blow
in
a
thousand
ways
from
my
experience
overconfidence
is
your
opponent
s
greatest
ally
do
not
let
yours
aid
malash
glances
at
artanis
spoken
as
one
whom
welcomes
defeat
our
master
has
already
won
alarak
you
will
lead
our
people
to
their
doom
you
are
right
about
one
thing
malash
i
will
lead
them
taldarim
by
the
rite
of
rakshir
i
am
your
highlord
listen
and
obey
malash
promised
you
lies
there
is
no
ascension
the
taldarim
will
never
be
uplifted
and
become
hybrid
amon
betrayed
us
and
for
that
he
must
die
alarak
the
taldarim
have
yielded
to
my
authority
and
the
death
fleet
is
under
my
command
i
will
use
them
both
to
avenge
amon
s
betrayal
do
your
people
believe
in
this
cause
as
you
do
what
they
believe
is
of
little
consequence
what
matters
is
that
they
obey
you
choose
to
rule
differently
than
i
alarak
despite
this
we
may
not
only
end
the
violence
between
our
kind
but
forge
a
powerful
alliance
can
we
now
my
people
are
vastly
different
than
yours
hierarch
we
both
desire
vengeance
and
we
are
both
protoss
is
that
not
enough
hmm
very
well
submit
to
my
absolute
authority
and
we
may
indeed
unite
our
forces
do
not
test
me
taldarim
amon
is
a
mighty
foe
your
people
can
not
hope
to
stand
against
him
you
will
side
with
me
and
together
we
will
send
him
back
to
the
abyss
chuckles
so
you
do
understand
my
culture
after
all
let
us
say
that
for
now
we
have
struck
another
bargain
my
brethren
hear
me
for
there
is
little
time
left
all
that
remains
of
our
race
our
civilization
are
those
that
stand
beside
you
now
and
those
corrupted
on
the
surface
below
our
kind
once
stood
as
stewards
of
a
galaxy
full
of
promise
in
our
pride
and
division
we
failed
that
sacred
charge
and
fell
into
ruin
the
khala
designed
to
bring
unity
ultimately
only
aided
those
divisions
its
hope
was
a
lie
today
that
lie
must
come
to
its
end
and
with
it
our
prejudice
and
arrogance
must
become
a
thing
of
the
past
for
now
we
fight
for
the
belief
that
our
kind
has
not
seen
its
end
that
we
protoss
can
stand
bound
by
a
belief
in
unity
and
that
we
protoss
will
forge
a
great
and
mighty
new
civilization
trust
each
other
in
the
fight
ahead
strike
as
one
will
let
our
last
stand
burn
a
memory
so
bright
that
we
will
be
known
throughout
eternity
amon
will
bring
the
full
might
of
the
great
fleet
to
bear
against
us
of
that
there
is
no
doubt
but
we
shall
not

you

you

yours

the

came
from

if
our

are
on

we
have
clearly
evolved
a
great
deal
we
sprang
from
these

they
are
so

we
will
grow
stronger
here
the

launched
thousands

at

relayed
this

it

it
